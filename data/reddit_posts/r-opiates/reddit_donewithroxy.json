I\u2019ve detoxed many times and I always find that if I use day 3 (oxy) I feel damn near out of the woods by the middle of the day on day 4 because I am able to sleep that night and it\u2019s not enough continuous usage to set back withdrawals. This may ONLY work for me or certain types of people but it\u2019s also a slightly slippery slope because I always try to get high on day 3, and we know how that can really reset the cravings aspect of detox.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}]}], "1_submissions": [{}]}]}
