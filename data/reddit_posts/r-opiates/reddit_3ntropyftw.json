I guess the internet has evolved past being mostly populated by nerdy young white nihilists and that the hyper sarcastic, nothing matters culture can be toxic to other people who don't think that way due to different experiences. I'm in no way a good person, but I try not to be bigoted because I'm a drug addict and bigotry is pretty harmful to us. Obviously it's not the same as being black because I could theoretically change but still lmao. You may already know this but it's very difficult for us white folk to understand what y'all go through.
