I came clean about my use for probably the third or fourth time with my wife yesterday.  It doesn't matter what you have opiates will always have that place in your heart.  I have a choice right now, I can keep doing opiates or I can keep my family.  I'm going to try to keep my family.\n\nMost people trying to quit will tell you how much they hate opiates and how awful they are..   I don't feel that way.  I love them and wish there was a place for them in my life but I clearly don't have the self control to use them responsibly.   They are too financially draining and they dull your emotions and sex drive.  No human should live their life addicted to opiates.  I've been physically addicted for about 10 of the almost 32 years I've been alive.  As someone who has been on both sides of the fence multiple times the clean life is more fulfilling.  I haven't tried it with my wife and kid in tow yet but I cant imagine the emotion my lil dude is going to bring me when I get back to normal (I'm on day 3 now).  He's 2 and although I have been a solid provider I haven't been much of an interacter.  Looking to change that.  \n\nJust know opiates will always have a pull on you.

I heard some people went to the hospital over them but I don't know what became of it.   I would like to find out what was in them.\n\nThe second time it happened I took 9 of the fake percs (inspected them very closely, even holding them up to my phone with a pic of a 523 pulled up and STILL fell for these motherfuckers!).

It fucking sucked so bad and I would only wish that feeling on one person.. the motherfucker dealing these pills.\n\nYou can check my post history I posted about it when it was happening bc I was legit worried about dying.   I was hiding my addiction (I recently came clean) and didn't wanna go to the doc.  Very scary experience and I feel so stupid for going through it twice!
