They became so complex to the point that Justin and Dan would both have to be Shakespeare to have planned it out that way.\n\nEdit: that happens with pretty much every popular show or movie, but it felt like this was happening in such a concentrated span of time that it became really annoying.\n\nI unsubbed before season 3 ever even came out.
