I\u2019m out of state for the weekend, back in my hometown. It\u2019s roughly a 2 hour drive from point A to point B, but it\u2019s 3 states away. I\ufe0f decide to try the whisper app.... again. It\u2019s totally useless where I\ufe0f live, back here is way more populated more big cities etc. some one posted \u201cblues\u201d .... I\ufe0f jumped right on it. Than it gets confusing. Dude is like \u201cI\ufe0f don\u2019t live in \u2014 anymore, I\ufe0f live in \u2014 now\u201d. So it turns out that he is originally from \u2014 where I\ufe0f live now, but he now lives close to my hometown. We talked last night, seemed legit. Decided to meet this morning, naturally I\ufe0f was pretty sketched out. We meet at a busy diner in the parking lot. It turns out we both have out of state plates.... from the same state! We shoot the shit, make the transaction. We both leave and get on the same highway and everything. It was the most \u201cnot obvious \u201c deal ever.
