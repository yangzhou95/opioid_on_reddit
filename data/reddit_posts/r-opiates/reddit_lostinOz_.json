Great parents, great childhood. Was a bit rebellious as a teen but nothing crazy just drinking and smoking pot. Then in college started dabbling with pills (30s) but didn\u2019t get carried away. It wasn\u2019t until after college, when I was bored by life and my job at the time that I started doing pills a lot. Basically half the week used then half the week didn\u2019t. I have never been a daily user. \n\nEventually that got too expensive so I decided to try heroin. I was so addicted to opiates that I couldnt give them up,  I was determined to find another way to feel that opiate bliss. I snorted it just like I would the oxys and what do ya know it\u2019s basically the same thing for a fraction of the cost.  So after that I could never justify the cost of pills. \n\nSince then, when using, I have only ever snorted it (never have shot it and don\u2019t want to). I do this on my own, I\u2019m not surrounded by friends who use or anything. Also never daily. Same pattern of binge for a few days, then a few days off. That in of itself takes willpower. \n\nI am not a stereotypical junkie. I am a software engineer (now I love my job so that helps!) with a wonderful family & good friends, and I know I can give this shit up again. I\u2019m not even tempted right now.

I\u2019ve learned that through interactions on the opiates sub.

So I relapsed. I had success for a year and a half. And then I fucked up. \n\nAbstaining (there is that better for you nitpickers??) from heroin for a year and a half is no easy feat.

Once you realize you can get the same feeling for a fraction of the cost... it gets hard to justify spending so much on pills (they\u2019re quite pricey).\n\nYes, complete secret aside from one friend who knows because she was up to no good as well. We live across the country from each other now though, so we can\u2019t influence each other negatively. She\u2019s currently sober and we cheer each other on. \n\nTakes a TON of willpower to not grab more after a binge. But I hate withdrawals. I was terrified of using daily and then one day not being able to get anything and being in so much pain / vomiting / all the other awful things that come with it. Because I\u2019d only use a few days at a time, my dope sickness wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as what others experience. The only time it made me so sick that I was vomiting was when my \u201cheroin\u201d was really fentanyl.... I believe that if I had shot up I would have died from that batch. Just sniffing small bumps made me puke at first, and then the wds did as well (yes I continued using the bag even tho I knew it was fent - addiction makes you stupid). That batch is what caused me to stop for a year and a half though .. it was a wake up call. \n\nMy wds were still tough though- whole body hurts and feels weighed down, insomnia, restless leg syndrome (THE WORST), zero motivation, depression, anxiety, etc. When I was on pills I don\u2019t think the wds were as bad because I couldn\u2019t do as much due to cost. So I just kinda coped with the mild wds that I got. But once I switched to heroin I was able to do more and they got bad enough that I wouldn\u2019t really be able to function without the help of Kratom. Kratom is a legal plant that clears up opiate wds but has a ceiling affect so you can\u2019t get high on it. I also have been prescribed to Xanax for a long time and that helped quite a bit too.\n\nMy motivation hasn\u2019t gone away, still full steam ahead on improving myself!
