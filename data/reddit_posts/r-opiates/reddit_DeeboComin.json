Thanks for the reply! This is a somewhat local case for me and there are all kinds of crazy rumors surrounding it but I couldn\u2019t agree more with every last word of your very well thought out post. I know the cops say the friend who spent the night has been cleared and he passed a lie detector test but I\u2019m sorry, the cops need to \u201cgo back to the damn drawing board\u201d (in the infamous words of Patsy Ramsey, lol). \n\nThe neighbors clearly didn\u2019t get along with Kortne but their reaction was to call the cops on her, not kill her. No one with a brain is going to murder someone who lives in the same house after first calling the police. And I agree one zillion percent that the \u201cangry\u201d stomping around could\u2019ve actually been the sounds of a violent incident taking place. \n\nI feel like the last time the neighbor called the cops (when they said they heard stomping, Kortne screaming, etc.,) that those sounds were very likely caused by whatever incident ended Kortne\u2019s life. And the friend claims he just slept right through all of this...\n\nSoon afterward, the friend starts building an alibi... he goes to the store to buy a drink where he is seen on surveillance footage, sends the text, etc. \n\nPeople around here talk about her getting kidnapped and murdered and thrown in a quarry because of drug debts but I think that\u2019s pretty far-fetched.
