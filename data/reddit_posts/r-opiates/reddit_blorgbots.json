It's made into the salt to make it snortable and shootable without adding any citric acid, which turns #3 into a salt for injection. Tar is just H made cheaply/more easily resulting in lots of byproducts still in the finished product.\n\nIf you have totally \"pure\", or perfectly synthesized, samples of all three, by weight #3 is going to get you the highest. It's just pure heroin. #4, or ECP also has the HCl to make it a salt, so by weight there's a little less H. BTH will get you the least high by weight.\n\nFunctionally, though, it varies a TON. Because they are in powder form, #3 and #4 are more easily cut, but it's not that hard to cut BTH either. Then there's fent and all that other shit... But since BTH is less potent to begin with, it often (not always) is cut less.

Though there are a lot of active byproducts like morphine and codeine, etc, which make up some but not all of that difference. So, I've heard (east coaster here) that it is even more sedating than \"just\" H which would make sense and some prefer.\n\nIdk what you mean by harsher, but it is for sure worse for your veins. It pulls up into this super dark liquid, and gets you to the point where you can't hit a spot quicker. I actually dunno how BTH users know they've registered...
