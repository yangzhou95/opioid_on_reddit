Details in comments.", "1_Text": "Sorry for the late response. Well, Vodou can be said to be morality based, but it is the morality that comes from people who often have to struggle just to eat. So whereas in neo-Paganism you will find a lot of looking down upon things like works to get a partner back, in Vodou that would not be as frowned upon, not at all. So there is that. You can't really get a good understanding of it by looking at it through an American lense, for example. You have to understand it in context. It is Haitian.\n\nIt is a religion. In the religion there is one God, and that God is far removed so the loa, the spirits, are intermediaries. Some spirits are very \"cool\", and these tend to be older and come from Africa. They are more forgiving. Some loa are \"hot\". These are harder to deal with and more dangerous, but any of them can be dangerous. Some of them are so hot that they would be what one might call \"evil\". But this get very complicated because there are thousands of loa and a particular loa may have a version in different families, such as Radha (cooler) and Petro (hotter). \n\nThere are con artists in Vodou, as in most religions and spiritual paths. \n\nAt is very basic level, Vodou is service to the spirits, the loa. Some just do that, and for an initiate this is often enough. If one serves the loa they can be asked for assistance. But it is also a healing practice. It is also about the Earth and the connection with the Earth. Often the healing involves a vast knowledge of the properties of various plants. Then there are those who do work within Vodou beyond healing. Some will generally only do helpful work, and that can be for various reasons. Remember, you can't really apply a non-Haitian values system to Vodou, at least to most initiates. Then some who do work within Vodou will do what you might call \"darker\" work. And that can get very \"dark\". \n\nSome who engage in the work are initiates, and some are not. But Vodou involves working with spirits, so how they \"get\" spirits to work with might be considered \"dark\" if they are not given to them through Kanzo/initiation.\n\nI feel like I am not giving you a good answer, or at least not a simple one. It is pretty late and I am tired so that is not helping.  The short answer would be that yes, it can have different sides such as a \"darker\" side. There are different aspects of it as well. It is hard to answer about what is common though, because there is no central authority, and every Vodou House will do things at least a little differently, and some do things very differently from each other. Some houses are more hot than others and work with loa that are more hot. But in general, at least in Haiti, I see mostly people using it to improve their lives. Mostly. Some also won't hesitate to use it to hurt others as well. And given how common Vodou is in Haiti, it is a fair risk, if you are concerned about such things.\n\nNew Orleans Voodoo is something different.", "2_Subreddit": "creepy"}], "d83omrj": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Items found while dog walking.

But so many are afraid of suboxone. A bad experience with precipitated withdrawal can give someone the equivalent of post-traumatic stress especially if it sticks around for hours and hours and hours. Because you don't see it coming and then all the sudden you are in a hell you never imagined.\n\nI had thought something like this would work. But I didn't know how and I tried to get started with it a couple of times and then just went back to using dope. So I googled it and found that same study. There is a table in it showing dosing. \n\nMy partner got a hold of some really bad stuff and ended up in ICU. Tested to have all kinds of weird shit in it. Benzo. Opiate. Even suspected flakka or k2. So be careful out there. But the hospital stay cleaned him up. I need to get clean now too. I do not want to drag him down and I know realistically because we've been living this way for years that if I don't get myself together it's only a matter of time before he's right back here with me. So I'm trying this again.\n\nThis is where I am. I started with a 2 mg strip of suboxone/naloxone and cut it into tiny tiny pieces. Took .25 mg in the morning the first day. .50 the second day. .75 the third. Then 1. Then 1.5. Then got stuck at 1.75 where I couldn't quite get the two for a couple of days without triggering the edge of precipitated withdrawal. I was using the whole time scramble caps sniffed.\n\nI got up to 2. Now I am up to about 2.5 mg. (I am using the 8 mg strips because I get less of that nasty taste, although I did cut up a 2 mg strip to add the .25's.) And I realized I misread the table for the first study which most closely matches my situation. It's supposed to be taken in 12 hour intervals, the suboxone, I think. So today I'm going to start the evening dose and titrate that up. Correct me if I am wrong. But based on the text, which states 12 hour intervals, and the table, which seems to indicate two doses after a couple of days I think I am correct.\n\nA few tips. Take it in really tiny bits because then if you trigger something you can feel it, and if you've been through precipitated withdrawal before you know what it feels like. And you can feel just the edge of it and get a handle on it before it gets worse. Don't put yourself through hours of Hell by jumping to one whole milligram to start, I wouldn't suggest. They don't do that in the study.\n\nIf you can start with the 2 milligram strip which are available that's really helpful. Obviously I have a lot of available to me I'm lucky. I find they sell for cheaper and they're really good when you're tapering up or tapering down.\n\nAlso I found this out the hard way and put myself through a few hours of hell. Do not take dope within an hour of taking Suboxone. It can trigger precipitated withdrawal because the Suboxone isn't settled in yet. I think what happens is the dope goes in more quickly than the Suboxone so the dope goes in the receptors and then it gets thrown out pretty quickly by the opiate in Suboxone  and that's what does it.  It was not just upping my dose of Suboxone too quickly because I had been at that dose for a few days when I did that. So that wouldn't have happened. It'll come on slow and take about an hour and then you'll be in Hell pacing the floor pouring sweat hurling and s******* your guts out. I'd say ideally wait 2 hours at least. I know people might want to argue with me on this but I lived it so I know. I had to miss work and everything, it was sheer hell and I was so shocked. Thinking I was so safe. This was on one of my earlier attempts at this. Learn from the hell I put myself through. Benefit from  me using my body as a science experiment. Wait at least an hour. Preferably 2. \n\nAlthough dope can rescue you from PW. That is why you titrate so slowly, because the PW will be minimal and something you can tolerate for an hour or two. In my case I get the edge of that warm flush that means I am close to Hell. Just the edge. And a bit anxious. \n\nEdit - Want to also add to make sure you also titrate down your dose of your opiate drug of choice too, or else you could just give yourself a worse habit. That's the deciding point right there. It's easy to start this method because you still have the comfort of using but you get to that point you've got to cut down. And then at that point you've got to stop. Or you'll just make things worse.\n\nIf anybody has been successful with this and switched over I would really love to hear your story. I think it could help a lot of people get clean. If that's what they want. No judgement.\n\nEdited for typos and clarification\n\nAnd to add\n\nTl;Dr This is working for me so far, no PW, I gave my dosing schedule and do not take dope right after suboxone or you can trigger PW.", "2_Subreddit": "suboxone"}], "dwoquej": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Has anyone heard of the Bernese method of induction?", "1_Text": "For reference my habit was 1 g a day at most.

I wasn't sure how long it would last I wasn't sure how bad it was going to get I wasn't sure if I could take a benzo to knock myself out. (And what I found is at that point it was K2 mixed in of some sort. They've moved on to mixing flakka with a benzo to take the speed away. Luckily I have not had that.)  But I was able to take a benzo to knock myself out and sleep it off because I find that experience miserable. It lasted for about 4 hours the first time it happened before I knew that. And I want to add I wouldn't recommend mixing benzo with dope even a little bit of dope because that can kill you too. Just as an aside.

Look on forums where actual junkies post experiences. Because you'll see some really negative stuff but you'll see some people who have tried this talking about how this saved them. There's even one forum post out there that you should find pretty easily if you play with that search where they talked about how they were able to taper from loperamide and get clean. I would be very concerned to try it but maybe a little to ease your symptoms would be at least a good thing. The dose for total withdrawal symptom control is a heck of a lot. I took maybe 40 mg. They takes a lot more. They bought the bulk bottle at a big store and used that. \n\nBut it is an anti-diarrheal drug. So you might want to take a stool softener with it. The guy who posted that description (as a heads up to others about a potential tool to help people who cannot tolerate or afford suboxone to get clean) I think said that in his experience the constipation wasn't too bad. Like Oxy, and he took a lot. But then I've tried loperamide it didn't really work for me. But I didn't try it in the super high doses. Maybe 24 2 mg pills, but that is nothing compared to what people take to help with withdrawal. Also make sure you read the risks. Like \"mega colon\".\n\nI'm not recommending that you do it. But it is something that might take away the worst of the withdrawal. Also be aware that the idea behind it is that it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier but then it kind of does and if you drink grapefruit juice that makes it ctoss the barrier more. Long story short if it's helping you you can probably get precipitated withdrawal from it just like you can with other opiates if you switch to suboxone. So I don't know that that's a good thing. It's also probably going to be restricted soon because of this use. \n\nI am not recommending it. Try looking into it. See if it makes sense to you.

Probably my guess would be that what you did wasn't strong enough to break through it. Now granted, at 6 mg it won't make you high but it can sometimes take at least the worst of withdrawal away. I just think that's so risky.\n\n The good thing is if you look at the \"Bernese method\", although that's not what you did, once you have that Suboxone opiate in you you should be able to take more within 24 hours without making it worse. But probably don't take more than 6 mg in fact you should probably take less than 1 mg to start. I'm not really sure. Because the Bernese method doesn't address this at all but given that you can add more because you already have a level of it in you, per the method and my experience, it would seem likely even though you took more dope. But I would cut it up in tiny pieces. Then take just a little bit at a time and watch yourself carefully . \n\nLike if you still feel sick 24 hours after your last Suboxone, try half a mg and watch how you feel. If you start getting that warm flush or feel a little more nauseous or anything to stop. Because 6 mg is a big initial dose. I mean really big. Even one mg isn't a safe initial test dose IMO despite people always saying it is. I wouldn't start with more than half a milligram and really a quarter of a milligram is better. The doctors behind the case study used an initial .20 dose. Given the hell you can put yourself through if you goof it up. This way you can feel the edge of those initial symptoms, you can feel if you get the edge of it and stop.\n\n\nJust as an aside in the interest of harm reduction. If you ever take Suboxone and don't get relief right away or you're trying to Bernese method of induction, do not take dope within an hour or preferably two hours of using Suboxone. The Suboxone seems to fill the receptors more slowly over the course of an hour or two. The dope tends to go in quickly. I have triggered precipitated withdrawal this way. What I suspect happened was it the joke went right in the receptors that the Suboxone opiate had not filled yet and made them nice and heavy. Then the Suboxone opiate went in and kicked it out and that's what did it.
