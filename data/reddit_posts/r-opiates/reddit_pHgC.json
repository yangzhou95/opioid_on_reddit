I'm sending you positive vibes all weekend. I've seen you around on here for a minute now. You can always message me if your struggling. I'm about 10 years older than you and have an absentee father in another way. I feel you on the therapist thing. The ones that take Medicaid are usually fresh out of college starting a career so it is hard to get on the same page and even harder to repeat it with a new one. The best thing you can do is just go to NA or AA not even for the program but to meet some good people. If the program rubs off on you then so be it but you'll at least find people who are tolerant twords drug users. My inbox is open.
