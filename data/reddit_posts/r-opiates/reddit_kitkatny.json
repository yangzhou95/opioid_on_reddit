The rule of thumb i used to make sure i never flew down a hole was use on the weekends, dont go a binge(which i did couple times but at the end of the week binge i got off, went through the WD's and didnt use for a little while). As long as you mentally prep yourself and take time off you can indefinitely keep using. Personally, i dont know about the boy situation since i made sure never to go that route. Keep it recreational, not addiction. Plus man, if you're making great money save it & do other fun shit.

Fml.", "1_Text": "I went through it(multiple times cause of multiple binges), its not as bad as people make it out to be is my point, countless shits through the day, 4 hour sleep a day,sweats and shakes RLS. Thats my point. Boo hoo, 1-2 weeks of sides effects, we all knew what we were in for, so man/woman up and do what you gotta do. We didn't complain when we were feeling good and knew that we would have to WD. If you want it bad enough you will over come it. The people who say they can't handle it just dont want to quit and rather go get high. It's just excuses. There are things people go through worse than a silly withdrawal. Thats just my opinion.  I've had times i got sick that would make a WD feel like a walk in the park, so bad i wouldn't wish it upon anyone. So maybe thats why i didn't think WD's are that bad.\n\nAs for the mental part, Each is its own case. Half the people that can't get off (this is no offense to anyone in this sub) just feel sorry for themselves constantly, think life owes them things without any effort and the whole world is out to get them/ put them down. Which isn't true. Its just an egg shell mentality. Using drugs is simple and fun, so keep it that way.
