But child abuse, assault, driving under the influence, neglect, etc, are all crimes in themselves. When we prosecute people for using drugs in cases where there actually are no victims, it effectively becomes a thought crime. I guarantee you far more lives have been ruined by the war on drugs than the societal effects of drug addiction on its own.\n\nBy the time you consider that prohibition failed horrifically with alcohol, and is obviously currently failing to curb the opioid and meth epidemics, it's clear that the best solution is legalization with regulation to ensure users are getting medical grade drugs with well measured and labeled doses. Use the billions upon billions of dollars we spend putting addicts into prison on voluntary, non-stigmatized, and free rehabilitation options instead.\n\nI know it's easy to look at the horror addiction brings to people's lives and the lives of their loved ones and decide hard prohibition is the only solution.
