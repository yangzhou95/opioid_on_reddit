So I\u2019m headed to meet this guy and he all of a sudden tells me he can\u2019t sell them unless I get a amazon gift card cuz he had to buy a gift for his kid, so of course I\u2019m wondering now what\u2019s going on. I offer to come get him and take him to buy the gift card with the cash I give him but told I couldn\u2019t stop and buy one first cuz I had to check the pills out first. This dude literally will not even meet me or anything until I get that damn gift card, so I end up just saying fuck it cuz it was all too sketchy.
