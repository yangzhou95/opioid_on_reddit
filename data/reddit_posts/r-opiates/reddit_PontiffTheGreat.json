And should be identified and treated as such.\n\n>isn't simply because of the neurobiology that results\n\nNote I imply this precise notion in the OP; the neurochemistry is typically the trigger, yet the primordial, persisting pathology after chemical equilibria is resolved is in fact a case of clinical depression; an abstract psycholathology, regardless of the trigger.\n\nYou make reference to a somewhat different context; a pre-use state of depression wherein opioid use is consequently engaged in as a method of self-medication. I dont mention this in the OP, but to discuss it; I don't believe self medication with opioids is inherently negative here. In fact I would posit that opioids are as you say; hugely effective for this purpose. It is a possible therapeutic approach that is however plagued by stigma, negative legal bias and fear of abuse potential. If used in a properly structured therapeutic regimen then I believe opioids are extremely effective, this us however unquestionably a difficult task to adhere to; as opioids *do* have poignant recreational potential and progression from use to abuse is very easy.\n\nNow for my overall psychological opinion. Having been treated with SSRIs and experienced my fair share of mental illness personally and academically, I dont think any medication (bar in a generally uncommon context; where an inherent neurochemical deficiency is evidently a core causal factor in mental illness), should be used as an ultimate treatment for said pathology. Including opioids. Anxiety and depression are almost always triggered, perpetuated and reinforced by higher level, abstract psychological elements; issues in perspective and appraisals, distortions of thought, overly reactive thinking, potent discomfort with uncertainty, catastrophic beliefs, pseudo-delusional desire for control and others. They are abstract, relational disorders. As put by my psychiatrist; medication does not and will never address the actual problem in mental illness, what they do is create space ane flexibility. **Psychology neede to go in this space, to address the high level, relational pathologies that at the very least; perpetuate and worsen mental illness.**\n\nI dont see your self medicating with opioids as inherently bad, but only if one is capable of *using* them in a calculated and structured fashion, and not *abusing* them. I strongly believe this is however not a context where some of the core issues underpinning your pathology are being treated. You should not neglect to undertake a psychological approach in parallel. My recommendations regarding this are the same suggested in the OP for post-addiction onset of depressive states.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dww7yu0": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Who got the link of the post about the guy claiming he's in Afghanistan or somewhere in Iraq or something about him and 10 other Muhammad's cooking up dope from start to finish.
