To be fair I think he mostly purchases fenced stuff now and resells it to some established contacts he has as he used to do it a LOT (judging by his rap sheet). However, even without that there is definitely something off. He definitely moves significant amounts of product (he showed me his stash once), but doesn't seem to have the corresponding amount of cash that he should (unless he was just faking an urgent situation to get me to pay him back faster or something).

Do not bring a baby into this world. I have been on the subreddit under different accounts for years and can still remember when you were still staying with your mom and encouraging her antics despite everyone telling you to leave.\n\n\n\nMore recently you have totally lost all your animals to the outdoors and managed to scam someone on reddit for some money to spend on a safe place (I assume because you're a girl and \"cutesy\" and definitely not addicted like everyone else here) You did spend all the money on a safe place right?? Because I seem to remember numerous spun out posts immediately after. To your credit (I think) you managed to find all your animals, but the way you talk about them sometimes makes it sound like you think they have the capacity of human children which I think is why you want this kid so bad. You want something to love you more than anything, and while your animals can provide affection they will still choose food and shelter over you.\n\n\n\nMore recently you have claimed that you are not addicted and even sober! ...I don't think switching back and forth been meth and heroin satisfies either of those definitions. You are homeless and sucking your dealer's dick and yet you refuse to acknowledge how bad your situation is. And THAT is why you should not have a baby because you need to learn how to take care of yourself (and your animals) first. Can you even provide for yourself, 2 dogs, 3 cats, and a baby?! And don't count on that dboy of a baby daddy to chip in - I guarantee he has other side hoes just like you so don't dare to believe for a second that you are special to him and that he will leave the life to start a family with you.\n\n\n\nLately you remind me of that Northwest Vae guy and I cannot for the life of me understand how you have managed to manipulate so many people with the cutesy persona that you project. Parts of this probably sound harsh and I'm sorry, but if you really want a kid and actually do have some genetic condition well there is always adoption.

I never said that you slept with your dealer for drugs though I'm sure you haven't turned down or complained about any of the free perks that come with it.\n\n\n\nI also don't think you're a moron nor are you a mastermind. You're simply average. I do however think that most junkies are naturally skilled at manipulation. This whole thread was just a giant cry for attention - your only clue that you might be pregnant is a late period even though you noticed spotting, or neglecting that are aware that your recent heavy usage of meth (and long term usage of heroin) could certainly interrupt your cycles.
