Blues is starting to make there way up there as second most common faked pill after Xanax . Like yea I get it completely cuz there IS DEFF a lot of fakes on the streets these days, an I run into them quite often, although I normally have my own scripts so I'm not too worried about it..

The dude didn't stop, but it was partly my fault as I have epilepsy an had a seizure while driving (they say I ran a red light an did a hit an run, I don't remember any of that).. My neurologist believes it a was a seizure that causes crash..\n\n Anyway, yea I'm in the Gunshine state down south... So pill mills are still around if you know where to look an have connections, not nearly as many as years ago obviously though.. But yea my most up to date MRI from a few weeks ago is going to land me a increase to bump up my IR 30's script an hopefully replace the dilaudid 8mg with OPana IR 10mg as well as change the MS Contin ER 60mg to OPana ER 20/30mg.. Which the doc basically gives u whatever u want as far as DOC.. Any opioid u prefer lol..\n\n But I have about 9 of my friends who go to the same doctor as me, an we also have another doc on the payroll about 2 hours from me who I got 3 people who go to that doctor... So I sponsor them all and get a minimum of 50% of there script every month, an sometimes I pay out of my pocket to fill there scripts at pharm, and pay for doctors appts, and sometimes they give me 80/100% of the scripts monthly if they aren't users themselves.. So we have it organized to where I have enough never run out of supply an make 25-30k off each 1k Blues lol... I also use a decent amount too for pain an sometimes abuse them myself.. \n\nBut no blowing involved... More like I *pay* him large amounts of cash every time me or my friends see him lol...! It's MUCH more regulated then before 2011 in my state, but scripts are still obtainable without a doubt... Just very strict and you need documentation an records of diagnoses/conditions and MRI's/CT scans/X-rays,etc. to prove medically accepted scientific based evidence to neccesitate pain relief/reasons for prescribing opioid therapy so the doctors cover there own asses an don't get in trouble.. \n\nPlus organized crime members are the ones who OWN the pain clinics down here, and they simply contract doctors and nurse practitioners to work as medical director/MD's/specialists for the clinics, and a lot of the times the only people to achieve large high dose, high quantity scripts to the extent I do these days, are people associated with the organizations, and those willing to pay the large sums of cash to obtain those scripts.. An it's a limited number of people they can allow those types of scripts to per clinic... So that's why so many people have trouble at pain management.. \n\nIt's because they don't know the ins an outs an the behind the scenes shit on how to work the system, an if they knew who really owned an ran these types of clinics, they would understand a different approach is necessary as opposed to acting like its 100% legit square doc's who will kick u out for implying anything.. It really depends on where/how the clinic is ran, and u can tell by the PM contracts they make u sign, the ones more laxed an less terms to follow on contracts are normally pill mills in my experience... \n\nThere's ALOT more to it than that, an you can't go by just that alone...

Although it's HEAVILy regulated and MUCH less prescribed than before, there's still MORE than enough scripts going around to supply surrounding states as well as us... The DEA regulates oxycodone down to every last damn pill these days from the manufacturing process, transporting/distribution chain, all the way down to when the pharmasict counts out your 120-240 pills and you pick them up... \n\n(Walgreens has a #120 limit on 30mg oxycodone, you must go twice a month if your scripted #240 here, 120 every 2 weeks it's bullshit) but not at mom an pops...

As well as quite a few doc's who genuinely didn't run pill mills, just made a few mistakes with the wrong people..\n\n Scripts are still obtainable to a great extent in every state in the U.S., for lean, oxy,OPana,dilaudid Xanax, adderall, anything you want really.. Thing that makes it hard now than back in the day is you need documentation and history of condition/diagnosis(MRI/X-rays/CT scans,etc.) showing SOMETHING doctors can use as an excuse to script you,because doctors need to have proof of medically necessity of opioid therapy based upon medically accepted scientific facts that you have pain.. And now there is FDA and medical association prescribing guidelines which limit what doctors can. Prescribe you right off the bat depending on the condition an severity of pain, whether it's chronic/acute, etc.. So it takes a while normally/legitimately to actually get large dose/large qty scripts of narcs.. Not like back in day at all but still possible.. \n\nAny way I'll stop ranting now..

That's why doctors/detox facilities won't give it to everyone, because not everyone meets criteria to take it, especially since W/D and opiates both either raise your BP, or the latter (opiate use) lowers it..\n\n My personally preferred at home detox protocol is as follows:\n\nALOT of good medical marijuana, as much as possible, for me about a 1Oz-42g is enough for a week in W/D(high tolerance I smoke a lot). it just became legal in my state, and I have epilepsy so my neurologist is helping expedite the process of obtaining a card, so I can have my Cali/colo imported trees here legally anyway lol)\n\nBENZO's (preferably Xanax/Valium) but any will work... I normally have extra Xanax around (I don't take my scripts, plus friends with scripts so I'm covered)\n\nGABAPENTIN I have tons of full bottles of 300mg caps lying around, I don't take regularly, but they help immensely for WD, an a shit ton of other things they treat..\n\nIMMODIUM I normally never take more than 2-3 pills MAYBE twice a day.. Normally 3 a day max. I don't abuse them like many on this sub, I think its crazy lol...\n\nKRATOM I don't always use this, but it can help some people a shit ton..\n\nCLONODINE I normally don't always use this either, but I have a bottle laying around, and if it's used properly, can be a HUGE help for WD, I find it helps almost as much as gabapentin..\n\nPROMETHAZINE/ONDANSETRON (phenegran/zofran) for stomach cramps, Nausea, vomiting, helping keep food/fluids down an stay healthy/hydrated during detox.\n.  \nALOT OF WATER/hydrating fluids, HEALTHY, CLEAN, NUTRITIOUS DIET AND MAX HYDRATION FOR THE WEEK PRIOR TO A DETOX, AS WELL AS THE WEEK DURING DETOX!! Use zofran/PROMETHAZine if you have it to help eat healthy during detox, you won't want to but u HAVE to.. EXERCISE IN THAT WEEK IF YOU DONT REGULARLY, it will HELP LESSEN SEVERITY OF W/D SYMPTOMS IMMENSELY!!! NO BS!!\nNOT REQUIRED: SHORT SUBUTEX/SUBOXONE TAPER.. \n\nI've successfully tapered off 240-330mg a day of oxycodone with a 7 day subutex taper.. Second successful 7 day taper was 150-240mg a day(my current dose again lol)... With NO withdrawals at all when the taper ended... \n\nMaybe it's just me, but it works magically for me more so than anything else, an makes detox a cake walk compared to how bad I've suffered cold turkey in the past... It's as simple as 8mg twice a day for 2 days, 4mg twice.a day for 2 days, 2mg twice a day for 2 days(day 5 an day 6 u can take 1mg at night instead of 2mg), 2mg once a day on day 7.. Nothing on day 8, no withdrawals at all for me.. \n\nIf u want u can do 10-14 days an taper a little slower, but that or anymore than that,then your risking starting to build dependency an instead of it effectively tapering you off your DOC, you now have to taper off the SUBOXONE itself to avoid withdrawals from the bupe.. \n\nForgot to mention, obviously the BENZO's have the addiction/dependency risk if used for more than 7-10 days...

I used to/still do to some serious extent move a lot of weight(that's how I was supporting a 6-10k+ a month SPENDING habit, atleast half of that was on drugs monthly tho..that's between smokin well over a half pound of exotic trees/Oz+ of shatter/wax, doing hella blues(main money pit),some coke, going out partyin/clubin/bar hoppin,an buyin all expensive ass designer clothes/watches/jewelry ... so in retrospect near 10k a month wasn't so bad to me since it was on living expenses(not including bills) too not just dope(I don't use heroin, maybe once or twice every few months IF that much.. I Just do roxi's) my bad for the rant... Just high as fuck smoked 6th blunt of the night an on 5 blues an a quarter of. A bar..
