You're user name also reminded me. No more fucking cold feet. Next to the shitting 8 times a day that was probably the worst part.

Why the fuck is that a withdrawal symptom?", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwmjgyl": [{"0_Comment Submission": "After 6 long years of growing tolerance and an increased mental and physical dependance on RX opiates I'm finally completely off.", "1_Text": "So originally I was on 4x 30 Mg Morphine ER / and 4 x 15 mg Oxycodone daily. I started by just asking for 15 mg morphine instead of 30. Then I just dropped one pill out every week or so. This part wasn't really difficult because I still had Oxy and Morphine kinda doesn't do shit orally besides stop you from WD.\n\nWith my oxies I went a little more hard core and went down to my lowest level I could tolerate without going into full blown withdrawals. For me that was 2 pills a day taking half a pill every 4 hours. Then after a few days I went to 1 and a half a day then 1 pill quartered out over the day. Then I would take a quarter at bed time and see how long I  could go the next morning at work without having to take another quarter. Like I said I had modafinil and gabapentin which both reduce cravings and delay the onset of withdrawals besides diarrhea which I had loperamide for. \n\nOnce I started getting close to 14-17 hours between quarters I felt pretty shitty so I stayed with that for about a week. By the end of that week I was able to go 24 hours no problem. Then one day I went 24 hours and I didn't take any pills with me to work and I just kept cruising from there. Today will be 3 days off. I guarantee if I took a pill right now I could shoot right back up to my original tolerance within a week if I was stupid about it.\n\nThis of course was my path, but you have to understand I decided over a year ago that I needed to do this. I backslid multiple times. I honestly attribute my success this time to the weather being really nice (Seasonal Affective Disorder) and my back being in a lot better shape. I also kept what I was doing quiet this time so I wouldn't disappoint my wife if I failed again.\n\nJust be careful and don't go too hard too fast. If you have your script this high its hopefully for a good reason. Maybe ask your doctor first about what their policy is on T breaks.
