My recommendation to you would be to reach out hospice now.   You are carrying so many thoughts that will interfere with your grieving process At the time your family will need you most.

I do hope you will take advantage of the resources hospice will offer as well as any local organizations that will help her children.\n\n I am so very sorry for the pain you are going through but please focus on loving her right now and enjoying life with her for as long as you can.   Families grieve, including spouses, in different ways and I have even had to call the police on families behaving badly at a patient's bedside at my unit.   Emotions run all over the place and people start questioning decisions that were made and family members lash out at each other simply because they're hurting so deeply.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me privately if you ever need somebody to talk to.  While I have never gone through what you are going through I can just assure you that all these feelings fought with a normal.  \n\n Your sister will need to know you are OK and you will help care for her children.
