Wanting you to hook up with her underage daughter? That's not a normal request, even by fucked up junkie standards. She's Trumps sister/business partner that's worth trillions (with a T)? That's so irrational it's honestly a little frightening... She really sounds like she's ill.. I'd be careful around her OP. Watch your back.

We're chilling and talking and I see this cop on the road next to the field across from where we are, probably like 100-150ft across. I'm like \"yo, cop. But u don't think he saw-\" and before I can finish my sentence he turns hard right onto the field and makes a b line straight for us lol. Me and my buddy just start walking faster still holding the blunt like we could out walk him in his cruiser or something hahaha but it really wasn't funny because we had more weed, a bunch of paraphenila, more shrooms, and bunch of other shit on us too when all of sudden in my totally fried mind I had the revelation to just throw everything over the edge of the field and onto the cliff (and possibly the highway below). I told my friend \"toss everything throw your whole backpack\" and he didn't want to but I said it again with enough urgency where I think I scared him into doing it on instinct hahaha. The cop got out of his car before it even stopped moving it felt like and whipped his light onto the two of us. He clearly just saw us throw a whole bunch of shit 50 ft down onto a major throuroughfare and he just goes \"..what're you guys up to?\" And we look at each other and I just piped up \"not much sir just going for a walk\" and he obviously knew we were full of shit but I honestly just don't think he wanted to deal with us and said \"alright\" and left. At the time we really felt like Johnny and Joey Badass forreal I think I was 18 at the time lol. Funnily enough my bro went back to that spot and climbed over the fence and down onto the rocks of that cliff like 2/3 years later and actually recovered the stash Arizona can with his pipe and weed in it from that night and we smoked a little bit of that same nug years later. It was terrible but it was mad cool the story came full circle.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwiqc9m": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Hopefully my last shot of dope.
