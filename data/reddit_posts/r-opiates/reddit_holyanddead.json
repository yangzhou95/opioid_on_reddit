But I noticed after checking them everyday while waiting for my pack and reading the new ones that came up I noticed a pattern. It seems as if 10+ transactions go through no problems. Raving about fast shipping and then a few that had no complaints about anything but the shipping took way longer than expected and then you would get a negative one saying he\u2019s a scammer and his shit is fake ect.  So either he\u2019s burning every couple of deals to try and make up for fees to cash out (or at least that\u2019s what I think) and I just happened to be the unlucky buyer or he is so swamped with orders he can\u2019t keep track of them and he is literally screwing up and thinking he made shipments when he didn\u2019t. I\u2019ll still hold out hope though it will still come through or I\u2019ll get my money back. Already deposited more to try a new one so fingers crossed this guy comes through. New guy already shipped so now it\u2019s just a waiting for the mailman game haha", "2_Subreddit": "darknet"}], "dwfno6h": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Don't know if I have liver failure", "1_Text": "So I\u2019ve recently been through this exact situation a few weeks back..this is going to be long lol\nmy sister who lives with me got her wisdom teeth taken out recently and upon asking her how she was doing she had mentioned that the pain meds they prescribed her made her sick and gave her \u2018the spins\u2019.  We both have had our past addictions but she liked to go up and I was the opiate addict so it made sense that she couldn\u2019t handle the pain meds they gave her. I had assumed they gave her hydrocodone but out of curiosity asked her what they gave her and she said \u2018oh I don\u2019t know oxy something\u2019 So then I get the itch and I went into her room while she was at work and looked for the pill bottle and found a bottle perc 5/325s so I started out with taking a few (4) so she wouldn\u2019t notice.  Anyways \nI end up doing all.Of.Them. \nShe had 18 and took maybe 1 and 1/2. Long story short I\u2019m an addict and couldn\u2019t help myself. I ended up just taking the whole bottle after being high for a few days because I knew she wouldn\u2019t miss them and if she did notice they were missing she would blame it on her ex that had come over recently. After using all of them up during a period of about a week I did have some slight withdrawal symptoms lol \nNothing like how I used to get when I was doing H for years with no breaks. I haven\u2019t done opiates in almost 4 years so I had zero tolerance. One of the days I took 5 and was so high I puked twice.

That\u2019s a pretty decent tube to use and it catches lots of resin so when you\u2019re out you can either scrape it or put a little water in it and plug each sides with your finger and shake it until everything dissolved and either snort the water or I\u2019ve recently heard you can use alcohol instead of water, dump the liquid on a piece of foil and wait for it to evaporate and then smoke the remainder.
