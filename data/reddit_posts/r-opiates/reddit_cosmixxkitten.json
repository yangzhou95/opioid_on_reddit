My 2x great grandfather's village is a well known Lemko village that exists in modern day Poland. His last name isn't a typical polish last name, in fact it's a Rusyn word. \nThe answer to your question lies in Operation Vistula, which took place in the 40s. Soviet/Polish authorities came and rounded up the Lemkos and put them on trains with their livestock. They were relocated to former German territories that belonged to Poland. When they got there, they weren't allowed their Lemko clothing. They had to speak Polish instead of Rusyn. Some of them returned to where they came from over time. Few people identify as Lemko in Poland, although after Operation Vistula it is estimated that there are 100,000 people of Lemko descent.\nWould I say they were an ethnic group that simply assimilated? No, although that would be the easier answer. I would argue that was all ethnic cleansing. I do not believe Rusyns and Lemkos are simply Ukranian. That makes no sense to me. Their DNA does differ from that of Ukranians. The genetic testing I, and other Lemkos I have known have done, shows Polish, Slovak, and Hungarian DNA, no Ukranian. Even if it did, it's not that simple, as the countries I listed did used to be a part of Ruthenia, after all.", "2_Subreddit": "Masastan"}], "duoatbg": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Any Denver ladies interested in a lesbian book club? \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udcda", "1_Text": "sounds great to me :)", "2_Subreddit": "actuallesbians"}], "duos71a": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Are Carpatho-Rusyns and Lemkos a separate ethnic group?", "1_Text": "Not all Rusyns are Carpatho Rusyns.

You also have to understand they lived under Austria Hungary for a long time, when the pan Slavic movement was ongoing because so many Slavic countries were owned by non Slavic empires. Rusyns have maintained their unique identity throughout all of this.\n\nIt's really just relative to what part of former Ruthenia they were living. That could be in modern day Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, or the tip top of Romania. Some Rusyns lived in Hungary.\n\nI can link you to some resources to make this more clear. Lemkos are Lemko Rusyn, and existed in modern day Poland. \n\nBut at the same time, just because their country doesn't exist anymore, doesn't equate them with Ukranians, Poles, Slovaks, etc. Their language is different.
