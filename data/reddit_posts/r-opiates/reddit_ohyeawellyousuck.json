Personally, I love being in a room with higher ups because I like to pick their brain. I also am unafraid to challenge views just because of a title, so I will take the opportunity to talk about various decision making processes so that I can understand them better, and, hopefully, the VP can understand things better by getting a first hand account of the ground floor.\n\nMany people walk on egg shells around titles, and I think that behavior leads to companies missing out on the opportunity to improve. The nature of corporate structure has decision makers removed from what is happening in the field. Even great companies that work hard on connecting those two worlds still miss out on some of the subtle but potentially important details.\n\nI've gotten push back before, but it's typically because of the environment in which I voiced my concerns and opinions, not the opinions themselves. I've been told multiple times that VPs and other execs respected my tenacity and valued my opinions, and so I believe good VPs will respect you more if you come to them with valuable information and even challenge some decisions. That is how companies become better. It's not unlike a normal day in the life of a salesperson, bringing up important conversations that may be uncomfortable, but with the intent of helping your customers (the customer being your own company in this scenario) get better.\n\nI'm not necessarily saying push your VP in your first meeting, but I always enter these types of meetings having done enough research to bring some value to the conversation, and I always try to make some sort of impact by voicing any important concerns that I have.\n\nIf that's too intense for your taste, be prepared with how your territory is doing and have an answer for questions like \"how can I help?\" Treat it like a sales call, and spend some time thinking about what he or she is looking for out of the meeting. Have a clear goal for the meeting as well to ensure it isn't a waste of time.

In which case I would be interested how you arrived at this conclusion, whether it be to looking at scientific studies or accepting a general consensus. If it's the ladder, you should keep in mind that we thought cigarettes didn't cause cancer for a very long time, and it was generally accepted, even in scientific communities, before research emerged that negated the opinion. Similarly, we thought breakfast was the most important meal of the day, skipping meals was terrible for fat storage, high carbohydrate diets were good for heart health, muscle confusion was a thing that existed, and many other topics that have been refuted as more research is done.\n\nI can see your on the defensive, so I should note I'm not attacking you. It is tough for me to see a comment that claims something specific is unhealthy without allowing for any discussion on the reasons for that viewpoint. \n\nFull disclosure, I personally don't believe red meat is bad for you, as I believe it is a stigma left over from a time when we didn't understand nutrition well enough to condemn certain food groups. That doesn't mean that I'm not interested in hearing more about a differing theory, but it does mean that I'm not interested in hearing erroneous metaphors that compare red meat to cancer meant to entice intense emotion without any backup rather than factual discussion.\n\nEdit: if it is a cancer conversation, I think it would be beneficial to dive into the studies, such as the WHO report, and talk about correlation vs causation.", "2_Subreddit": "funny"}], "dwrlb1s": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Lethal Things...", "1_Text": "Then you are a moron because you never read any of those studies and everyone of them is a cause of correlation, that's it. Those studies talk about the connection between eating red meat and a very small risk increase for colon cancer, but none of them are able to connect the red meat specifically to this increase in risk. It's also thought to be, if anything with the meat, due to a portion of the red meat leftover from the animal that acts as a carbohydrate, not due to the protein and the fat content. However, this isn't clear and isn't proven so it's at best just a guess in an attempt to connect red meat to the problem. These examples could also be indicative of other things that people whom eat red meat typically do, representing the real cause that most likely has nothing to do with red meat at all.\n\nStop throwing Google sources around when you clearly have no idea what your talking about.", "2_Subreddit": "funny"}], "dwrlzkv": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Lethal Things...", "1_Text": "I wish more people had the aptitude to actually think before spouting bullshit.
