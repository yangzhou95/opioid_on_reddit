When I'm hit with a scary, hard desire to use again...I tell someone (usually my husband) that I'm feeling this way and ask if we can do something distracting in the moment. Like play a game, go for a walk, anything that is engaging mentally or physically. I find watching tv or reading a book doesn't help me with cravings because it's easy to zone out and continue thinking about the urge to use. This might not work for everyone, but consider giving it an honest try and see if you can work on something you enjoy or do anything that will distract you (no matter how hard it is to find the motivation to start doing it!) and see if that helps. What your feeling is your brain lying to you. Nothing that comes from inside of you can be stronger than you. (That affirmation really stuck with me and helped me in my tough times too...the cravings cannot be stronger than me because they come FROM me). Another thing that has helped me when I find myself obsessing over using and thinking \"I can't do this\" in regards to my sobriety, is to remind myself \"you already are doing it\".

They are there to support you.
