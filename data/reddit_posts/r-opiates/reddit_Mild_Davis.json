I guess you gotta get on a label to get the Grammy, like ho Kayne said to Chance the Rapper \"heard you gotta sign with a label to get that Grammy\" or whatever. But they are complex. I only knew them after them were blueface. Its like a wu tang thig, OR (ill say it) a OFWGKTA situation, group for unity, then launch each career independently of each other for MAX profit, the idea is pretty simple. If you, look at OF, they released things PERFECTLY, until BLONDE, when frank dropped it indie, instead of his last album for Island def Jam (??) but he did it without or on contract independently, HENCE no Grammy nominations for BLONDE. Music business is ugly unless you can just get past the TOP 40 hang-arounds. (JEAN GRAE IS KILLING IT SHE HAS BEEN INDIE FOR...EVER) I just look at what is popping and let my brain decide.
