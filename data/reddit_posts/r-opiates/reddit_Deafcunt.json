I love dark ambient music. I also use a selection of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works (mix of both) as meditation music. Shit goes deep if you let it...\n\nAnd you can never go wrong with Boards Of Canada. One time I was walking home from a friends house coming down from LSD at like 3am. I was only wearing a wife beater and basketball shorts which had a huge buldge from the oz of pot in my pocket and about 20 lorcet in the other when a cop started tailing me. I remember BOC's Everything You Do Is A Balloon came on my shuffle as this cop slowly drove past me then turned the corner to come back around to nab me. I knew he was gonna do this the second he turned so I ducked into an alleyway as quickly as possible and hid in some bushes. Sure enough, right as the drums kick in on the track this fucking pig slowly creeps from around the corner... totally looking for me. Thankfully I could see him but he couldn't see me. He gave up eventually and I high tailed it home, but i remember it was such a perfect song to randomly come on as I was dealing with the acid paranoia of having this cop following me. Everytime I hear it now I still get a bit uneasy... such an amazing song though.", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "dpjshm1": [{"0_Comment Submission": "You know you're a junkie when....", "1_Text": "I fucking hate that!

I've always opened up a Bobby pin or a paper clip and scraped.

It burns because the quality is great. \n\nTypically when I get dope that doesn't have a twinge of burn and goes down smooth I won't get as high. The dope that has a slight sting upon first snorting usually gets me the best.\n\n2. It burns because it's stepped on. \n\nThe burn from shitty stepped on dope doesn't initially burn until you start to get the drip. It's a different type of burn than quality stuff as its not burning your nasal cavity but burning down your throat.\n\nI hope this makes some kind of sense, and this is strictly from personal experience...
