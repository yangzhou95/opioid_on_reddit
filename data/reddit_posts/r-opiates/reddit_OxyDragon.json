Your primary doc would refer you to a sub doc, or U might be able to call around local sub docs and see which ones take your insurance, and if they would be willing to prescribe to you without a referral from primary doc. \n\nWith my insurance it was easy, I have an HMO where all the diffedent types of doctors are in the same big ass building. I just made an appt. with the Behavioral Health department and asked to see their Addiction doctor and she gave me the choice between methadone or subs. I said subs, but have yet to fill the prescription.
