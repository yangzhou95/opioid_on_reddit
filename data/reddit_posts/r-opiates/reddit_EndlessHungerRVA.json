I limp in their shadow, beating myself up for being apathetic and bored. I\u2019m on subs, and I thought they would always keep the craving at bay. It pushes it down, but knowing what I\u2019m missing can really be a motherfucker. Luckily, having suboxone in my system reminds me that even if I got something I wouldn\u2019t be able to get high for days, so at least it\u2019s a crutch. Sure, I have dreams and wants to be more productive, pursue those dreams and reap the enjoyment and benefits down the road, but motivation is lacking. Heroin would deal with all of those problems, even though it would come at a high price. I know having the desire means I\u2019m supposed to turn harder into my sobriety and go to more meetings and follow the program but some days I just want to get high and feel untouchable. \n\nAll that said: Great fucking job on being clean for 1 year and 3 months!
