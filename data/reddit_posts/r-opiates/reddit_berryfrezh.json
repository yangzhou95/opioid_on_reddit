I didn't do anything beyond weed for 3 years after he passed then I learned the healing powers for myself that was drugs to cope with the void he left with me. So technically he succeeded to an extent, depending how you view it. \n\nI was extremely sheltered without realizing it tbh. I was also exposed to the harsh world somehow. The number one thing my parents did with my brother and I both was never belittled us for making a mistake or unfavorable choice. They actually sat ringside to catch us if we fell, but they wanted us to learn and experience stuff for ourselves as to get it out of our systems. Drugs in high school were far less tempting knowing they weren't so forbidden in my house. \n\nAll I'm saying is be accepting if mistakes happen but be her voice of reason when needed.
