All people care about is the propaganda pushing media and we end up with what seems like 75% or more of the population brainwashed and only concerned with what they're told to be concerned about. This leads to a population of completely uninformed drones just repeating nonsense and the real issues never even get talked about. There's all sorts of logical solutions to all the issues we face but when only a few people know or even care about them we're basically screwed. I've tried numerous times to type out long comments full of facts trying to explain to other misinformed Redditors problems and solutions to some of our bigger issues.

They had to go through training and a extensive FBI background check in order to receive thier certificate. They're only allowed to draw thier weapon under life and death situations. How often have you been in that type of situation, do you even know one person that had been in that type of situation?  I don't know one person who could have legally drawn a weapon because as civilians we avoid conflict and it would be incredibly rare to be in that kind of situation. Police deal with dangerous people cor a living, trying to  compared them to civilians is ludicrous. Not to mention police are trained to use force and threat of bodily harm as a way of having the upperhand when dealing with potential violent individuals.

It sounds like you're watching way to much sensationalized news and only seeing the awfully negative things they shove down your throat all day. The most simple and healthy advice I can give anyone would be to stop watching the news. I gave up cable television years ago and it made me a lot more positive and open minded. I've lived in the USA my whole life and I've met all sorts of races and there are good and bad people of every color and every religion. Human's are all capable of being messed up regardless where they live our how they look.   Also judging someone based on how they're at the one point in their life and thinking they're always like that isn't fair either.

Every year we find out more reasons to not just treat everyone dealing with certain mental difficulties the same way. Physical illnesses that are incredibly difficult to detect on labs have been found to have severe psychological side effects. When those individuals are just labled mentally ill and thrown into that system horrible things happen. Often they commit suicide if they're not treated for thier physical illness.  Treating mental illness is beyond complicated, we don't understand enough about the brain or why certain things happen to help some people. Furthermore lots of people end up seriously declining when they're forced into mental institutions. Life is hard, there is no magic solution you can force a seemingly mentally ill person to do that's going to just fix them.  The most important thing we can do is be loving and understanding even though we cannot relate to what they're feeling. Be patient and listen to how they feel, don't just give them a cold shoulder because we believe they need to do things differently.    \n\nLook what happend back in the early to mid 1900's when massive institutions were common. People were forced away for thier whole lives because of illnesses we'd never think of sending them away for now. The barbaric lobotomy was invented and used frequently on people who could have lived a decent life at home if thier family was capable of accepting that they were different. We've come a long way in regards to humanely dealing with the mentally ill and mentally disabled. The biggest progress had been in accepting people for who they're and letting them live a decent life as long as they're not threatening physical harm to anyone. \n\n\nTrying to constantly tell someone who's struggling with mental health issues that they just need to take medications or go and be committed for the rest of thier life isn't helping them at all. All that's accomplishing is making that person feel completely alone and misunderstood. If someone is making threats to harm others and or harming themselves than they need to be committed for as long as the doctors feel appropriated. But those actions often don't mean that they will be there for that long. The goal is not to just lock somone up if they're found not to be a danger to themselves or others, it could only be a few weeks from what I've seen others go through. I dated a really great girl for a free years who was diagnosed with bi polar disorder. The experience really opened my eyes to all the issues I've  expressed and since than it's given me a interest to educate myself on the subject.

AMA", "1_Text": "Christianity has it's foundation on forgiveness to anyone who wants forgiveness and a change of heart regardless how terrible the sin they committed. Jesus pleaded that God his  father  forgive the Roman soldiers who taunted and tourtured him the day of his crucifixion. My favorite act of forgiveness and love of God to change every mans heart happend with Saul. Saul was one of Christianity's worst enemy's in it's early days. He went from town to town gathering as many Christians as he could to put them to death or prison if they were lucky. He was Jewish and did not believe that Jesus had been the true son of God who had been professed in the old testament. One day as Saul and his group of helpers were traveling Jesus spoke to him from Heavan. The whole group heard Jesus say  \u201cSaul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\u201d Saul asked \"who are you, Lord?\" Jesus responded \u201cI am Jesus, whomyou are persecuting,\u201d\u00a0he replied.\u00a06\u00a0\u201cNow get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.\u201d  Saul was blind for three days after this incident and his men led him into the city where a priest whom Jesus had chosen and instructed of Sauls transformation and his importance as a servant of God was waiting and praying. When the priest put his hands on Sauls head scales fell from his eyes and he was able to see again. Saul ened up becoming one of the most influential followers and teachers  of Jesus in all the days of Christianity. His transformation was seen by many of Jews as proof Jesus was the true son of God and they became followers and ultimately saved. \n\nBasically the whole premise of the new testament is that we're fallen and sinful because of the original sin. We were given all sorts of rules to live by in the old testament that if followed were supposed to please God and make us worthy of his presence and worthy of the gift of eternal Heaven. Not one man couldd be worthy of these holy gifts no matter how hard they tried, the sinfulness that was within all of us made us incapable of getting even close to deseveving of the the presence of God based on our works. God than decided he would send Jesus his only son to teach of the new way and ultimately die on the cross only to be resurrected for all the sins mankind would commit so that by our belief in Jesus we would be able to go to Heaven. Ultimately it's the best gift we have ever been given, belive in Jesus and want to be the best people we can be through prayer, forgivness and faith and we are given the ultimate gift of eternal life in the presamce of God.   \n\nReading through this section of comments was really sad, I pray that as many of you as possible are touched by Jesus's love and have your hearts changed in the way he wants all of us to be. Life is so much better once you can forgive those who we feel have wronged us, regardless how bad they harmed us we should want them to recive forgiveness and the belief and faith in Jesus to also go to heaven.", "2_Subreddit": "IAmA"}], "dv2736m": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I gave up alcohol when my daughter turned 1 (left).
