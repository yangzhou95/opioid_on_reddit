I spent all day yesterday shitting and vomiting at the same time and then I couldn\u2019t even get up to clean it up and I thru up bike all over my couch and my dog. And have spent st least 10 of the last 24 hours in the bath because that\u2019s the only place I\u2019m comfy.  When you want to get high remember the kick bro.  Remember that sucking feeling in your chest and don\u2019t think positive thoughts about heroin.  Don\u2019t go down that road and stop looking at all the damn heroin porn on the sub. Good luck also it\u2019s not the end of everything if you do use just don\u2019t do it again and make sure to tell a trusted pal about your indiscretion if you do get high so they can have a talk with you if you start sliding.  Good luck", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwqtfyh": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Your roasts can\u2019t be any worse than my thoughts \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe", "1_Text": "Courtney Love put down the fuxin spoon", "2_Subreddit": "RoastMe"}]}], "1_submissions": [{}]}]}
