Christine\u2019s reaction was just wrong, I get there were cameras rolling and all but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first she\u2019s been in front of a camera she needed to stop and think. I often say the first that pops into my mind but I\u2019ve been trying to do better bc some folks don\u2019t like cold hard facts. I\u2019d much prefer the cold hard facts myself. I feel badly for Mykelti bc she will forever have that memory of her mother being less than thrilled about her choice of a partner. Then Christine, Robin and Kodi all make it worse by their over the top sucking up to Tony. I\u2019m happy to see that Christine was self aware enough to be nervous meeting Tony\u2019s family bc she knows she was wrong. Being the type to say the first thing that pops in my mind I\u2019ve had to eat lots of my words over the years and it sucks. That said I\u2019m a big enough person that I can admit i reacted harshly or unfairly and go directly to the person I offended, I don\u2019t play these suck up games the dam Browns play. Seems to me all of that sucking up just pours salt on the open wounds, but then again I think Tony sort of enjoys all of the extra attention.", "2_Subreddit": "TLCsisterwives"}], "dwxa8lu": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Just got a chance to watch the second tell all and a few things jumped out at me", "1_Text": "Hell yeah loves it!
