The majority role being played by increased heroin supply and that supply being tainted with fentanyl. There was one article in particular that someone posted a while back that did a great job breaking down the statistics, I'll see if I can find it. I mean when you think back, historically the state hasn't typically done a stellar job with laying blame proportionately.\n\nEdit: I believe I found it, here it is: https://www.acsh.org/news/2017/10/12/opioid-epidemic-6-charts-designed-deceive-you-11935", "2_Subreddit": "OpiatesRecovery"}], "dwal2ew": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Couple articles on America's WAR on pain pills.", "1_Text": "Also, my statement was intended to *support* the points in the articles that you originally posted here. So let me clarify what it is exactly that I'm trying to express, and that the author I linked you argues for, because I fear I may have come off the wrong way.\n\nDid Big Pharma do wrong? Absolutely. That's what they do. But the mainstream view has put up Big Pharma's sins as this like huge animal sacrifice on the altar so to speak, to make it look like we are doing the right thing with the \"crackdown\". But these are the claims that are unsubstantiated: 1, that Big Pharma's evil doing created a whole new sizable population of addicts. That is difficult to prove. Maybe they only added a little bit, or not at all - maybe the pool of drug addicts is virtually the same, but now they are simply dying more often, because of the fentanyl problem. And 2, that current and past attempts to reverse what Big Pharma did wrong are helping or have helped. Like for example, the article points out that overdose deaths were stable in the first decade of this century up until 2010 when there was a new abuse-proof form of OxyContin which correlates perfectly with a spike in OD deaths - and while that is still an action of pharma, it is first of all not the action that the main narrative points to as the root of the problem, and second of all this phenomena does not suggest an increase in addiction, only an increase in deaths as a result of addiction. That is to say, the existing addicts switched products.\n\nI just think this whole crackdown thing is such bullshit, so inhumane, and salt in the wound is that it also represents yet another smokescreen thrown on the population preventing people from actually learning about real addiction.\n\nIs that more clear...? (btw, here is another good one by the same guy: https://www.acsh.org/news/2017/08/16/heads-sand-%E2%80%94-real-cause-todays-opioid-deaths-11681)\n\nEDIT: but see, the thing is that without a good massive-ass scapegoat, the state or the \"system\" or however you conceive of our country's dominant power would be forced to acknowledge the only remaining possible cause of the creation and maintenance of all these super mentally-ill people: a toxic ass culture.

I'm fascinated by such dreams. Thanks so much for sharing.\n\nMy dog that I grew up with fought a long hard battle with cancer before we had to put her down.

I remember the moment and the feeling so clearly, and I knew I would never recover and I never have. But my point is, re: dreams like that.. after she died, I was so upset constantly thinking about how she had suffered *so* much before she went, and then...\n\nShe came to me in a dream. It didn't feel like a normal dream with her in it, I mean I'd dreamt of my dog a bunch of times, but this time it felt distinctly different, like I had no control over or input into it... like there was really \"someone *else*\" present.

In fact we weren't distressed at all, quite the opposite.
