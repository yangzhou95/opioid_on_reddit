Easy peasy. Double your usual dose, in the morning or whatever. You will be zooted and should be straight for at least a few hours. It lasts a long time, if you eat a lot you can get real fucked up, and find a happy medium, it\u2019s a real upbeat, productive high.

I never have gotten pulled over while geeked up...and my god I hope I never do. But I have had mostly pleasant experiences with this the couple times since my DUI in 2013, That one was not so pleasant and I was young, kinda retarded, irresponsible and belligerent. But oddly enough this all got a lot better after that, I lost the taste for booze and don\u2019t drink like, at all. Now I just do drugs. \n\nMostly, I find with the po-lice, haha, smiling a lot and using my somewhat high pitched, innocent sounds voice works to my advantage as well. I don\u2019t come off as a degenerate/someone who has dope in her bra. And I don\u2019t go around doing shit that attracts much attention from the cops and I don\u2019t fuck with the tweaked scene around here because those morons get themselves arrested for dumb shit constantly. No thanks. I never let any of the people I use with bring random friends I don\u2019t know along in my whip. Cause if one of those motherfuckers has warrants and who knows how many felonies on them, I don\u2019t want to end up having to share it with them when we get pulled over. Used to have a friend that carried a briefcase sized lock box everywhere finally I realized \u201cthere\u2019s probably a good 25-40 year sentence in my fucking backseat\u201d. I\u2019m not going down for that, really just dont with dumb motherfuckers, too high, really shouldn\u2019t drive high/drunk at all,  drive responsibly and ideally, have all your shit legal, don\u2019t drive people around while they go hit a lick, make runs, steal their friends TV again, etc.  Also, be polite, it usually goes a long way unless the cop is a bitch or you got caught playing with your dong on playground or something actually fucked up like that haha.
