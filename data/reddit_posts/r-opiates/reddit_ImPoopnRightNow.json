I've jumped off cliffs before just so the ass clown invading can't get the satisfaction of taking my last slither of health and sending a \"gg no re\" message. It's argued that invading is a part of the game and that's true but you don't have to be an asshole about it. I like the idea of an invader dropping embers or efigees or whatever, and joking around from time to time. If you really want to play pvp why not join a fight club or something?       \n\ntl;dr- Probably shouldn't disconnect but you also shouldn't be an asshole when invading .
