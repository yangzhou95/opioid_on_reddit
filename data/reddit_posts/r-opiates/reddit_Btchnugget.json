All methods require budgeting your expenses to gauge how much money is going to certain things(bills, food, leisure, debt) and how much is being saved. Even though you may not have money to save it, you can use it to pay off other things that you wouldn't have had the money for otherwise.

It just felt really good and my tolerance was pretty high for all three at the time+ depression for countless months. Im only speaking for myself here, but the more depressed you are, the more you push limits and boundaries(drugs, sex, gambling) cuz you dont really give a fuck. Xanax just adds to the stupidity and poor decision making skills. Don't try any of the above combos as they are super dangerous. He was definitely suffering severly with physical and mental scars.
