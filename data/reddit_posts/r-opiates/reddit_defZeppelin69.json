She\u2019s constantly shopping out at stores or online, buying shit she doesn\u2019t need whatsoever, with plans to \u201ctake it back.\u201d Every corner is packed full of bags of old crap, like old unworn clothes with tags on them, bottles of hand sanitizer and soap to \u201cuse as gifts,\u201d etc. \n\nEvery time we mention throwing shit away she says absolutely not because it\u2019s wasting it. Somehow 20 year old junk has some sort of value to her. Our basement storage room is packed full of old bikes, decorations, furniture, etc. so is our garage. \n\nWhen we convince her to actually start clearing it out, this entails her spending a couple of hours \u201cgoing through it\u201d, which means moving it from one bag to another. Then she gets on the phone and ignores it for the next few weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s not a healthy lifestyle. She\u2019s so embarrassed that she isn\u2019t willing to have guests over anymore even though she\u2019s a social butterfly. My dad has had to move down into the basement, their only contact is when he comes upstairs to tell back at her after she nags him from upstairs all day.\n\nHer mattress is 16 years old and causes her aches and pains that she constantly complains of. But she won\u2019t get a new one because she doesn\u2019t want the two random delivery men to see her mess. When I mention they can deliver it to the door and I can move it into her room, she comes up with some other excuse to not get anything done.\n\nSorry for the rant, but it\u2019s not something I can just tell people who know me and a lot builds up.\nThe sad part is I\u2019m a lot like her and take after her, though painfully aware of it. I have the same tendency to ignore my problems and get too overwhelmed to deal with them", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwe3ylk": [{"0_Comment Submission": "The average d-boy.", "1_Text": "Marriage takes sacrifice", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwefx4f": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Earning that hustle", "1_Text": "I actually recently moved back in after graduating college, so I get to see it all first hand and experience everything over again", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dweoqvm": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What was your \"I shouldn't have said that\" moment when talking to a customer?", "1_Text": "Not always a good move.
