Because of this it left their angry poor population susceptible to anyone with a group to blame, which happened to be Hitler saying that the Jewish bankers were responsible for the poor economic state of Germany. I sometimes wonder if he really believed this or if he was just smart enough to ride the wave of Jewish hate he started to the top. Either way, he\u2019s still a disgusting person.
