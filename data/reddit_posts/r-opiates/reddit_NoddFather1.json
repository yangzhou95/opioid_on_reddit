Dunno what to believe but it was pretty clear he was trying to take my money before, he had that crazy look in his eyes and was yelling like he was going to kill me", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dvii1zo": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Longtime D-boy turned on me today...never seen dude like this! Be safe peeps!", "1_Text": "Let me update this post....I really appreciate all the positive responses, you guys are awesome!\n\nWell the guy has been calling me and begging me to forgive him for, \"acting like his younger self\"..he always uses this explanation of being some sort of ultra gangster when he was 16-20 years old..ie, robbing people, stealing cars, kicking down doors, pistol play, heavy drug stuff, you know a regular ol Kodak Black type of dude.  \n\nHe also blamed it on \"too many people thinking hes sweet (soft)\" and \"fucking with his money\"..this I do understand since Junkies can smell nice dealers from a mile away and we will push this to no end.  I have admittedly done this probably to much, like coming $5 or $10 sort sometimes or insisting on a front here and there. He was yelling at me about owing him money, which I currently dont and he said he had me confused with another of his customers who has been dodging him amd not paying...\n\n Im sure this can get super fucking annoying, and junkies struggle to see things from the dealers point of view.  Im guilty of this too, and act like Im really entitled to credit or deals from time to time since I spend tons of money with this dude.  He doesnt give two shits about this tho and needs to make his profit and if all his customers are being cheap that cuts into his profit.  So he leveled with me about the money issues he is currently in cause one of his guys burned him pretty bad and my guy couldnt pay his rent this month.\n\nSo after a 10 minute phone call, which was super eye opening to how this game plays out from the dboys point of view, he asked if I still needed some dope and we would meet in a public place and talk further.\nI did agree to meet him and work this out cause he really is a good dude and never acted like this before.  We met at a busy restraunt and sat down to talk.  He was super apologetic and did seem authentic about this situation.  We talked for like 30 minutes, he was cool, promised it wouldnt happen again and everything went smoothly...well what would you guys do here? Let him slide due to stress and he just doesnt know how to handle himself other than getting \"ganster\" with me or say fuck it and throw away a great connect...", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dvk194l": [{"0_Comment Submission": "My middle left the plugs # in my phone", "1_Text": "Hahaha this exact same thing happened to me a long time ago..my piece of shit running mate at the time would use my phone to call his plug to get us both dope and usually found some way to rip me off.

Could we work together and leave him out of this\"\n\nAnd it started a great relationship and I found out how bad this \"friend\" was ripping me off, kinda killed that friendship\n\nJust come at it chill but let the plug know who u are and how u got the number, just tell him ud bring him more business if you could work directly", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dvu4cop": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Breakfast, dinner and supper - everything from one spoon \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294", "1_Text": "No HEAT damnit!
