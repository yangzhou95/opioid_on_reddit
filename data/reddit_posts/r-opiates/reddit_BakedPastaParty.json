I absolutely love music and subsequently stopped my guitar playing in the throwes of my addiction. It really roots out any other part of your personality. Having a foundation of hobbies and positively productive activities to fall back on when breaking away from your addiction is the most often overlooked part of treatment by addicts. You dont really realize how much time is spent straight up scheming, picking up, and just being high. Its a full time job and all that boredom and time to fill is the biggest trigger for relapse.\n\nThanks for your kindness i really cant say enough how much i appreciate it :o)", "2_Subreddit": "CasualConversation"}], "dw851c8": [{"0_Comment Submission": "13 years ago today The Office aired for the first time ever", "1_Text": "Jims double chin?", "2_Subreddit": "DunderMifflin"}], "dw8k0h2": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Facial reconstruction on a child with Crouzon Syndrome", "1_Text": "Science is a liar sometimes", "2_Subreddit": "WTF"}], "dw8kwj2": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Speedy Gonzales", "1_Text": "EVERY GTA IS RIGGED IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARSSSSSS", "2_Subreddit": "nononono"}], "dw9a63h": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Phone booths are disappearing to make it harder to leave the matrix.", "1_Text": "Just reposting", "2_Subreddit": "Showerthoughts"}], "dwb64ik": [{"0_Comment Submission": "TIFU by letting my friends slap my butt", "1_Text": "I feel your pain bigbutt i get them as well.
