I just wish I didn't start to go into opioid withdrawal near the end as it was hurting my back while trying to relax and watch the movie.\n\nIf the US Netflix has SAMSARA I highly recommend watching it on mushrooms or acid only if you're an experienced tripper.  Also preferably watch it sober or at most baked first before diving into it on mushrooms. It is the most gorgeous film that I've ever witnessed but also quite emotionally intense and turbulently realistic and almost difficult in its ordered chaos in certain moments.", "2_Subreddit": "shrooms"}], "dwptfvw": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Ultra Low Dose Buprenorphine", "1_Text": "Roger Rabbits experience with using on suboxone was that if Roger Rabbit dosed in the morning on Monday, by Wednesday evening- roger could shoot a point and get nicely ripped. Typically before starting suboxone roger would easily have to shoot 2 to 3 points for a decent high. I think it kept his tolerance strangely low (keep in mind this is fent dope and 1 point is not 100mg of pure fentanyl but an unknown dosage... thanks black market)\n\n\nI also wondered if naloxone could be used to lower tolerance as well the same way naltrexone potentially can. Could be risky, tread carefully SWIMMERS.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}]}], "1_submissions": [{}]}]}
