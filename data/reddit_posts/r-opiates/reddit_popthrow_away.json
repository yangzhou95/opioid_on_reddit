If you are seeing oil it means the seeds have been in the water long enough to start absorbing the water and releasing oils. You're basically trading the alkaloids you want that are in the water for poppy seed oil. Poppy seed oil does nothing for our purposes, what you want is the coating on the seeds. Hot water has been proven to give more alkaloids both good and bad. Acidity seems to only help with the less desirable alkaloids. I've found that the best water temp is completely based on the seeds. Seeds high in M and low in other alkaloids are great with hot water. Seeds low in M and high in other alkaloids are better washed with cold water. I always use cold water first on new seeds, if they are weak I try hot. I don't think there is a goldilocks temp that will give you best results for all seeds.
