Idk i only looked at one of the links on his certified dank page where he makes fun of peoples houses. He also said something about how snobbery intensifies in the wine cellar pic.

But yeah like I said I could only stomach going through one of his links before getting angry. I just dont like the thought of putting people down and judging them, especially since most people have to work so hard to put themselves and their family in such a beautiful home, only to be mocked and judged by some prick on the Internet who begs people to pay him.through patreon' sorry just doesnt sit right with me.
