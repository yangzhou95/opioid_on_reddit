But if you typed that and posted it then I don't think it was fent. And by that I mean it probably was fent but not carfent. Most powder dope these days has fent in it. Fent can be safely abused to get high, its just stronger than heroin so it can be dangerous if you get some thinking it's dope and do too much. Its that bullshit fucking carfentanyl that will fuck your shit up. \n\nThere was a post a while ago where people compared dozens of stamps that were tested. Literally almost all of them tested positive for fent. A month or so a go there was a bust in Brooklyn where there was something like 200 kilos of fent recovered and only 2 kilos of heroin.
