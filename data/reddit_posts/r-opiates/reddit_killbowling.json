Then I start to crave benzos again, but instead of just continuing to medicate I want to start to fix the problems that xanax fixes, just without the xanax. Like learning to be less anxious. And yes I do get peace of mind from stimulants. Trust me after about a .15 shot of ice, ain't nothing going through your head but bliss and positivity. Sure some paranoia and the comedown sucks. but what I meant was trying to achieve the clarity of thoughts that I have on uppers. I have hyperactive / scattered thoughts and stimulants help to organize all that.\n\nAs for heroin, can't speak too much as I have never abused opiates long enough to consider myself a junkie. But I do know that the feeling of relief that opiates gives me (besides the dopamine rush), mainly stems from letting me forget about my anxiety and adhd.\n\nI think the main point of my post was to explain how my enjoyment of different drugs has brought me some insight into what flaws I have, and how different ways I can try to fix them without drugs. Like meditation, exercise, different hobbies, eating healthier, spirituality, etc.\n\nYou are probably correct saying I am a little too optimistic, but oh well.
