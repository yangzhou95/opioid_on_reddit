That is when I started receiving morphine and Demerol, anti-nausea meds, at a very young age(Metabolic disease I would prefer to not specify).  While at a hospital receiving exactly a billion &1 procedures, one was a spinal tap(age12).  The Dr. told me that I \"may experience 1 to 5 migraines\" as my spinal fluid replaced itself over time.  About two weeks after the spinal tap, I was walking around sea world with my mom, on my way to pet the sting-rays when I noticed I felt odd.  By the time we reached the sting rays, I couldn't see half of them, my vision was mostly blocked.  I later learned that this is a migraine \"aura\".  This started my years of hell enduring the most intense & painful migraines you can imagine(actually I'm sure you can).  I came back from sea world to the hotel room and vomited and flailed around for five hours screaming.  That's how they usually go.  Standard treatment USED to me either intramuscular morphine shot, or iv with phenegrine for nausea.  I'm in my thirties now, & sadly still get them, not as often as before.  I've tried EVERYTHING.  Been to one billion and 1 neurologists.  I've tried preventative daily drugs that made the water from my shower hurt my skin(side affect).  The only thing that helps is opiates.  Now they say they won't give them bc of\"rebound headaches\".  The treatment has taken a complete 180, & if I go in to the ER they look at me like I'm insane for wanting meds & pump full of benadryl IV and send you home.  No matter what.  Honestly, what is happening as far as Dr.'s going the complete opposite direction in managing pain & accessing each patient's needs are insane.  Everyone is lumped together & receives the same treatment.  They don't care what works best on me or anyone else.  Sorry for the ridiculously long response, I guess I needed to vent lol.  Best of luck with getting what you need.. I hate that I even have to say that.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwcd2kc": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Another policy update: the community members have spoken!", "1_Text": "Shut the Front Door!\ud83d\ude31", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwcj5tc": [{"0_Comment Submission": "QUESTION:", "1_Text": "XD", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwcmyqe": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I dont have health insurance, are there doctor offices where you can pay $50 to see the doc", "1_Text": "I\u2019ve been to one before, years back in-between insurance. I payed forty bucks, & they offered very basic, very simple on site testing and services. They had their own on-site pharmacy in a tiny room.  This place wasn\u2019t crooked, in fact the opposite. It was there to offer care to families namely children, of whom don\u2019t have insurance. I was given a paper bag with antibiotics and vitamin c after coming in with bronchitis if that helps.
