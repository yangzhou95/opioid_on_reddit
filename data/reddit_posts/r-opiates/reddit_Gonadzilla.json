I'm not a medical professional, but I honestly believe that opiates would be better/safer and more effective in some cases for treating emotional/mental issues, than popular anti-depressants and anti-psychotics (used for treating depression!). \n\nDrug laws are useless and blow. Legislation is mostly meted out on the poor, in the worst way possible. \n\nI used to make excuses for my opiate use, and in some cases they were valid. However, I'm 54 and have been using for over 30 years, off and on. If I'm being honest with myself, it was not the best way to deal with my emotional pain, probably short term, definitely long term. I think you pay a big price. As you imply, it's a bad long term solution, but you know, once you go down that road, you just keeps renewing the lease. I guess I'm suffering some regret.
