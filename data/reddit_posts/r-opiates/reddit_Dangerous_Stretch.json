Turns out it is like OPs place and its an 'abstinence' facility - turns out most are. I get drug tested randomly and they test for everything even kratom. I also was told that the psychiatrist I will be seeing there will not prescribe me the adderall I take for ADHD nor any benzo for anxiety. \n\nSo I am going through the motions and my piss comes up dirty from the kratom and I just got so pissed that I decided to say fuck it I am going to get a doc to prescribe me suboxone. It was really easy and at least now I don't have to stay completely sober. The day I told my counselor she had this look of horror on her face as if I admitted I murdered somebody - she asked how long I will be on it 'only for a few weeks' I said nah its probably going to be a few years before my brain gets back to normal - somewhat joking.\n\nThe next week they tell me I have to sign a consent to let them give my drug test results to my doctor and told me I should get a 2nd opinion from the in-house doctor. \n\nAt this point I remember I have to meet with their stupid psychiatrist. So I take matters in to my own hands and find a out of network psychiatrist - I was more honest with him than I should have been but he is chill. He puts me back on Adderall and Klonopin and tells me that he prescribes suboxone and confirmed that it sounds like a great idea - I take him up on the offer because I would have had to pay 200 a month just to see the sub doc.\n\nI can't wait till tomorrow to tell them that I am back on my meds - and this time when they ask me to sign their hippa release form I am just going to say no. By telling the pdoc everything I am no longer worried that they might tell him something and have him drop me as a patient as they did with my last doc.\n\nI understand fully that I abused alcohol and weed but for gods sake dont punish me by taking away the meds that help my quality of life - they rather I suffer through my panic attacks and not be able to perform well at work than allowing me to take my meds. I beat them at their own game. These places truly suck and I hate that I have to be here - I rather just go to my SMART meetings and avoid abusing alcohol. Once I realized that they cannot **make** me go to an inpatient program I decided that idgaf. They keep saying that x,y,z are mandatory - as if I can't go on google to see if I **have** to do what they say - turns out 9/10 times I don't.\n\nI can't wait till I get out and never go back to this place... I was tricked into going because I was told this was a mental health intensive outpatient program turns out it's for addiction. Maybe they knew I wouldn't go if I was told that it was but it's not like I wouldn't know the second I went there.

I guess his addiction never went away as one day I went for a session and I could see that in the back yard there was a hookah, I didn't think much of it until a few minutes later he kept nodding out. I found it hilarious as he didn't hear a word I said. Then towards the end it was time to write my scripts up and as he looked to go through my medical chart I realized I could easily take this for granted - so I did.\n\nI told him I needed to up my Adderall from 10mg twice a day to 20mg xr and two 10mg ir pills as a booster. Bam he did it.. then I asked to switch from klonopin 1mg to xanax 1mg three times a day, and lastly I tried my luck one more time and asked if he could write me a prescription for vicodin for my headaches, once again no problem, he wrote me a script for norco 5/325 every 6 hours as needed.\n\nI really loved that guy :-)", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwgpkmo": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Jesus fucking Christ. \u201cThe Doctors\u201d show is stalking about narcan parties..", "1_Text": "I didn't know they gave people in the psych ward internet access..", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwgpx9e": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Jesus fucking Christ. \u201cThe Doctors\u201d show is stalking about narcan parties..", "1_Text": "I love dope. Dope is the best. I love dope more than my girlfriend. Dope dope dope. Sometimes when I am alone I take out my insulin syringe and shoot some dope into my veins. I used take pills after a surgery but than I got addicted and started snorting heroin. Than that wasn't enough and I would smoke some bth but nothing beats watching the blood go into the chamber as I inject. I probably use two grams a day. I but H by the kilo and it last me over a year. Its just cheaper to buy in bulk than to go out a buy an ounce or two a month. So what dope is great I work on wall street so money isn't a problem. If I am at work and want to use I go to the parking garage and take my dope out of the trunk and will snort a couple of lines. It makes work go by so much quicker. Before bed I will take a xanax a soma and shoot up. Then in the morning I do it all over again. I do take breaks though I have a stash of suboxone I take during that time so my wd isnt that bad. Then I start again and do it all over again. I have an apartment on central park west and my gf lives with me, I have two cars and a vacation house in colorado. I am always happy because of the dope. Dope makes my life so much better you should try it sometime - try to avoid dope cut with fent.
