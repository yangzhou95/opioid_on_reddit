I took it and absolutely loved it. I feel like it changed my life. I got into the rave scene in Los Angeles and the Desert Party scene. I would go up to LA every weekend, and maybe come home on Monday. \n\nFast forward a few years, I lost my job, almost all of my friends all because my life revolved around partying. \n\nWhat you're experiencing is the after glow of a \"life changing\" event because you got opened up to a side that you didn't know existed.
