Totally, in a pure chemistry sense, but not when speed is both l- and d- amph and definitely just one drug to the user. I'm gonna happily concede you are correct, but would sound sorta goofy to a meth head or something along those lines. Meth is l- and d- meth (unless it's the good stuff, which is just d- meth), but both together is still one drug. \n\nAnd the point still stands that amphetamine refers to amphetamine, and if I remember right the first comment that started this was just referring to amphetamine. \n\nEDIT: refers to speed, which is only standard slang for amphetamine, at least among drug users.", "2_Subreddit": "IllegalLifeProTips"}], "dwwdo7a": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Typical Samir", "1_Text": "It's a knock-off rice paddy squat.", "2_Subreddit": "weekendgunnit"}], "dwx8abn": [{"0_Comment Submission": "BeatGunnit show n tell", "1_Text": "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by autism, starving hysterical tendies.", "2_Subreddit": "weekendgunnit"}], "dwx9ekj": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Nice try ATF...I'm not givin up my pupper that easy", "1_Text": "Hey, maybe he's a felon.", "2_Subreddit": "weekendgunnit"}], "dwxb8d7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How the world looked at the time of Crucifixion of Jesus Christ [6206x2674]", "1_Text": "Until you remember \"veni, vidi, vici\" is pronounced \"weni, weedi, weeki.\"", "2_Subreddit": "MapPorn"}], "dwxce3x": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How the world looked at the time of Crucifixion of Jesus Christ [6206x2674]", "1_Text": "The way the Catholic Church pronounces latin.
