Believe me, I have tried. I tried to get back into the activities that I used to be very passionate about, but the spark is just gone. The drugs completely numbed me to anything I ever loved, and anything that ever made me happy. I'm trying. I do go to therapy once a week, which is ok. Honestly I don't know what to do. My brain just isn't happy anymore. All the chemicals the brain releases to make you feel happy and ok with life seem to be completely depleted. Sad, depressed, and numb is pretty much all I ever feel. \n\nThanks again for the positive vibes. You didn't have to do that, but you did. That is so much more than what I get from the people that are important to me. The people I used to consider my friends and family.

You do what you have to do, right? I don't know how I did it, but I was always able to keep it within reason. Of course you binge sometimes, it's unavoidable. But somehow for the most part I was always able to stay very disciplined. I tried to look at it like this: I'd rather have a little stretched out for a longer period of time, because I would at least have something just about every day, than do a lot over a short period of time. I don't know, I was just always good at stretching it out. I didn't have a choice really. It wasn't my prescription and it was my only source.
