My car was sick, black on black real gangster looking.\nMe? I have short pink hair, barely 5 feet tall, 100 lbs, wearing a hot little mini skirt and a sexy tank top...\nI was pulled over by HP.... and as I'm pulling over, I realise.....there is a 3 foot female plant...RIGHT. IN. MY BACKSEAT!!\nOf course I freak, I'm considered eating that, but really, having dirt and \"flowers\" all over my face and spurting out my mouth will NOT win me any points...\nSo I grabbed this $3 window cover, you know, the silver ones people use to keep their car cool? I threw it over the plant.... He comes to my window, does a double take when he sees I'm no threat ( maybe BC I also had my left leg propped up, and you could totally see my undies unbeknownst to me until I drove off giggling...\nHim: you were doing 102! I clocked you! ( I had slowed down when he clocked me BC at that moment my little Japanese Chin, Maximus, threw up......thank goodness for dogs! )\nMe: oh my gosh! I'm SSO sorry, my dog got sick and I know that there's a rest stop right down there, I just wanted to get her cleaned up! ( which was true )\nHim: license and registration please.\nTakes it to his car, yes, I'm shitting my La Perlas, I'm going to jail, I'm getting a ticket, kill me now...\nComes back to mycar and says, \" I see it's your bday....I also have about a 650$  ticket for you........but I see your wearing your seatbelt. Here's a $50 fine. Have a nice day, and Happy birthday... \"\nI called my boyfriend after I drove to the rest stop and he just about died laughing.....", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwgy2cy": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I got pulled over today..", "1_Text": "My thoughts exactly", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwgylm4": [{"0_Comment Submission": "The time I stayed with my dboy for a couple weeks....", "1_Text": "Right?!", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwgymry": [{"0_Comment Submission": "The time I stayed with my dboy for a couple weeks....", "1_Text": "And you keep being a prick.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwgyop9": [{"0_Comment Submission": "The time I stayed with my dboy for a couple weeks....", "1_Text": "Was Dan a big shit talker?", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwgyvro": [{"0_Comment Submission": "\"'it's so insane how this drug has taken hold over me.\"", "1_Text": "I totally remember Tracy from that HBO doc! \nI'm shocked she's still alive.......\nThe High on Crackl Street was great, too, with Brenda and Boo Boo!", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwgyybx": [{"0_Comment Submission": "\"'it's so insane how this drug has taken hold over me.\"", "1_Text": "Oh, wait I didn't read the article....\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude25 poor Tracey.
