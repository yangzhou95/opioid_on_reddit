While opiates provide pleasure, they will **never** provide real happiness, and if anything they will take away from that in the long run.\n\nMy advice to you is to take the money you would have spent on drugs and travel, or experience things. Even spend it on doing things for the people you love. I can 100% without a doubt guarantee you will get more or of it than you would shooting it into your veins. Read some books on fulfillment (I always recommend The Way of the Peaceful Warrior or Alan Watts' books). \n\nThe only person I would recommend opiods to is someone in hospice care or in extreme short term pain. Even those in long term pain would be better off seeking physical therapy, doing yoga, and taking ibuprofen, since opiods will actually increase your pain over time. \n\nThis board can be dangerous in that people show off their drugs that they're excited to have scored. Make no mistake: nobody that's an addict is happy.
