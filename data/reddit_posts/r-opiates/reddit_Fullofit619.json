So if you need to get some dope so you can get well for now and get some Subs and a good time to kick properly, using the fake pee is really the only sure option you have. It's highly unlikely they'll supervise your UA, even being a government job. They usually only observe in rehabs and parole/probation tests. I used to have to test for work through this testing facility that only did drug tests, and they only had me empty my pockets and lock them in a case while I UA'd. No pat down, just sent me in the bathroom alone. Idk man just trying to give you an option because I know how bad youre feeling, and adding the stress of the upcoming test can't be helping.
