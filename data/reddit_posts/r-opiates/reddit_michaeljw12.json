I started trying to think of counterpoints and things that are even better and the main one that popped into my head was that the glow from sex is at least a magnitude stronger than selflessness. I started writing a long reply but to my dismay, had to delete it.\n\nI changed my mind because even though sex might provide the most intense feeling of human connection, feeling connected and in tune with another person is only one piece of the jigsaw puzzle that makes up the broad and inclusive experience of feeling human as a whole.\n\nI think you might be right, I can't think an example that either I nor most others would probably agree beats it. Granted, what it means to be human is an entirely subjective question and if every person on earth wrote an essay on it, you would probably have around 7 billion unique essays lol. I appreciate the food for thought.\n\nAnd shit G, if I had a list of all the shit choices I've made that ended up causing collateral damage to other people in some shape or form, there's no way I would be able to read it without breaking down into a slobbering mess.\n\nGo out and help someone out for no reason and accept that what you did today, last month, and last year can't be changed. All you can do is learn from it and take an earnest shot at righting the wrong that you feel needs to be. And hey, don't beat up on yourself about not being able to fix it all, life has a funny way of working itself out.\n\nLike I mentioned, karm-othafuckin-a lol.

Just a shot in the dark, but I would bet our annual OD mortality rate would drop to under one percent of it's present state. Unfortunately, this is an unthinkably radical solution for most people to be on board with and it just isn't a realistic possibility anytime soon.\n\nWe would also benefit greatly from the implementation of set standard for drug education in public schools that was rooted in fact and completely open and upfront.
