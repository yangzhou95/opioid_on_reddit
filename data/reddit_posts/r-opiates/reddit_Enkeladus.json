Please don't view this as disingenuous simply because it's not curtailed entirely to your unique situation. I'm trying to help the best I can by simply explaining the process of what is all going down from my bio-psychology based perspective.  \nAddiction is considered a brain disease. This is because you start out using out of boredom, curiosity, pain, pleasure whatever. The disease of addiction doesn't solidify itself then, but simply plants the seed. It is a process that builds once you start incorporating the choice to use into your daily life. Say you start off only using randomly, then once a month, then every other weekend, then three days a week and finally every day. Now the frequency is important, but it's also what you do while you are making those decisions to use. Say you use every time you go to the mall with friends, every time before you eat a big meal, every time you see your. SO, family dinners, before getting a haircut, going to the library, to class, to the bar to become more social, on rainy days, sunny days etc. Each one of those circumstances required you yo make the intial decision of using before/after or during. Once you do it once, the seed of habit is planted and just since we are creatures of habit we will often use a 2nd, 3rd, 4th time during those events ad infinity. What I'm saying is you start to reprogram your brain to associate all these activities with using with every new decision that you choose to use in. And by repeating them you condition yourself, much like Pavlov's dogs mouths watering when the bell is rung indicating food. This process specifically occurs in the amygdala (emotional center of the brain) and hippocampus (memory center of the brain). So think about it, you are telling your brain with every choice over the years of your growing addiction that every time we do X( is the activity, even if it's just sitting in your room - it's an association), and Y(is the drug of choice). Your emotional center of the brain and memory center are becoming reprogrammed with every new use further strengthening the addictive process. It's an insidious thing that is almost impossible to be aware of as it happens over such a period of time. The science shows it. We can see differences, physically and chemically in an addicts vs. a non-addicts brain. The good news however is that the brain is quite neuroplastic, meaning you can reverse the habit or coding you have implemented via your choices. The thing is though, it is a long and arduous process. This is the journey of a thousand miles, beginning with a single step. You, once the initial shitty feeling of withdrawal is over, really really have to force yourself to do new things. Anything that breaks the code should help fight the constant bombardment of cravings your addicted brain will send out. You have to actively and in real time, re-teach your brain to live without the drug. This can best be done by exercise (fighting things chemically as you will create your own endorphins to satiate the brain for a time being). But more importantly the long term solution is tackled by doing new things that help form a cycle, a new habit to follow. A habit purely based off sobriety. You will need to start associating X, the activity, with a new variable that is no longer Y, the drug. Now I don't know what the new variable(s) will be for you but I do know that forcing yourself towards a end goal is the answer. Time can be your enemy and your friend. Combat it by doing or creating anything meaningful to fill all the new free time you will have. Re-teach the brain to form dopamine based on sober activities and refuse it of the instant gratification via drug that it was taught beforehand by yourself. You are both the marble and sculptor of this new sculpture of sobriety to be made. You as you have already seen will fail a lot I'm sure, but this is the only way to do it. You are truly in control, the science backs it up. The question is though, can you hold on for one more day, can you chip away the pieces of the addicted brain and smooth over the rough marble edges with your new and quite heavy tool - sobriety based will?\n\ntl;dr - Doing things will help you feel decent quicker. Sitting around will not recondition your natural chemicals as quickly.

If she gets sad upon viewing this post than it means she just wants things to work, but doesn't know the solution. Once you can both admit your relationship and overall health are more important than either one individual such as you or her then you can finally let your guards down. Maybe just mutually agree that ya'll are both messes and are equally shitty, even if that's not true. Possibly concede in order to make the other feel better, help them so that they can help you. Because take it from me, I would have killed to have my ex-gf with me during my recovery. Instead I fought it alone and I think that severely damaged me. I really can't answer if staying with her would be more toxic than being alone or not. But, if you are fighting about petty things other than staying sober, then I suggest moving on. You should be a solid team that is unshakeable. Don't take shit out on eachother, just forget about your egotism, who cares who is right or wrong, why you are fighting, this and that. Debate to solve the problem not to win the argument because the problem can, if left unintended, develop into something much worse than a bruised ego. \n\nThis is life or death here in a sense when it comes to sobriety.

HOWEVER. I do not believe this can be achieved for any normal person. One would have to have an obscene amount of discipline built up prior from the original addiction, loving family and friends would be an absolute must as psychology shows connections and their counterpart loneliness affect health in a tremendous beneficial and negative way. Also, use would almost have to be regulated by someone else who is impervious to the lulls of addictive substances. The thing is though that none of this seems possible, it's too idealistic, too many things could go wrong and until we as a species overcome the more basal mind regarding emotional decision making we will not be rational and just use in recreation. Especially after the brain has already been predisposed to such a extended period of conditioning in where it always craves drugs for nearly any activity we partake in. We are responsible for creating the disease of addiction. \nThis disease doesn't happen immediately, the brain physically changes overtime, the reward system learns that this is all there is and that I no longer have to produce natural dopamine because when I do a hit of this or a shot of that I satiate more than what was needed. Everything has an equal and or opposite reaction. You think the initial withdrawal is the opposite reaction of using, but it isn't. It's the cravings that last for eons that are the real opposite reaction, this is what you are experiencing now so I don't think Kratom usage would be a good idea at this point. Time is the thing that will erode all your grand statements and declarations about recovery away. Just forget about using for now.\nNow when I think about someone at nearly the 3 month marker drug free I think goddamm, first pat yourself on the back for getting this far. So many people struggle with just a few days or a week. The naltrexone is a good idea but it's a shame it's giving you side effects. Is it the implant version, because with that you can have all the cravings you want but the simple fact is that opiate blocker is under your skin and you can't use to get high even if you wanted to. I don't think that's a permanent solution though. I think some part of addictive thinking stems from a more philosophical basis. See for me personally I started using to make fun situations more fun, and then my discipline dwindled over the course of months and then I started using when waking up and just bored, and eventually I was using when facing absolute despair. The thing that helped me, believe it or not was a mix of getting in trouble with the law (probation for a few months) and more so picking up reading again. See, sometimes I think people use because when you really look yourself in the mirror and ask what is the purpose of life you really can't answer that question with a concrete answer. So this uncertainty sometimes can eat away at you as you can create all these meaningful ideas to pursue but when you are feeling down you are just going to say, well, \"wtf if it's so purposeful than why is it fading so easily\". And that's that thing, an existential crisis can really be a crutch, for me at least it was in the recovery process. I simply couldn't believe that there was any real point to life and so I resorted to hedonism (point of life is to get as much pleasure as possible). The thing is though that this philosophy of pleasure seeking is not sustainable. And here's why. The brain simply works through one of Newton's 3rd law I swear. An equal action has a equal and opposite blah blah you know. You can't bombard your brain with 5-20 times the natural amount of dopamine it receives during a opiate use intake and expect no repercussions. It just doesn't work that way. The brain will say \"fuck this I'm not wasting energy producing natural endorphins when they are just given to me.\" That's why you experience something called anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) after long term opiate usage. And yeah, this anhedonia can last for a real long time. So that may be what you are experiencing right now. The last stages of withdrawal are the end cravings and realization that \"okay I've been clean for months now and nothing is as good as getting high flooding my brain with 20 times it's natural dopamine production\". Well, give your brain a break, it's been doing it's best. \nOk I've been incessantly rambling, the real point I want to make to you is this. You have to give it more time, the brain is neuroplastic but can only recover so fast. Who are you to say that you are feeling normal yet. You might think that you are 90% back to how you were before opiate use but who knows, you might still have quite a ways to go. It truly depends on your unique situation and how fast you naturally recover. Now I don't necessarily agree with everyone else here saying that Kratom will reset your receptors back. But, I do agree it could be a slippery slope decision. If you are going to use Kratom just a little crutch, than blow up your spot. Self help yourself by possibly self destructing your former addictive mind by telling people in your immediate life like friends/family that know you already use that you are going to use again. Hopefully one of them understands addiction enough to say \"ok he/she's been clean this long so let's just treat this as a treat\". Guess that's a little too idealistic as well but idk it's 2am and I'm trying to think of any ideas that would help you. \nOh, also. I highly recommend reading some literature and any research articles you can on the subject on addiction. (I can link you some articles if you want) And actually, not just pertaining to addiction but in addition to reading books on buddhistic philosophy if you find that interesting. It's all about resisting the temptation and doing things in moderation. Of course any drug is not allowed but hey, I take the lessons I want from various philosophies in an eclectic way. I highly recommend the book Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. Seriously, after reading that book I was clean for 3 months straight. That's how powerful of a message it had. Mainly though your recovery success is going to be based off of the everyday decision. I really suggest picking up some new hobbies to keep your mind occupied off of the cravings. This shit is very brain based so it's really you (your consciousness) vs. the chemical balances you have each day vs. time. Some days you will feel like shit and others you will feel alright. The days you feel like shit you need to stay busy because simply reminding yourself that you will feel better maybe after you eat or get more sleep is great and all. But sometimes the negatives get overwhelming and not everyone can just sheer force of will themselves into happiness on command. I mean yeah it's important to know every mood will fade but come on, this is a life or death situation in a sense as relapse can lead to. Better to just pick up some hobbies to help create some meaning in your life. Force feed yourself meaningful opportunities. Combat the addiction by re teaching your brain that you can have fun doing normal things. Fuckin join a yoga class, meet some girls (if you are a guy), join a dancing class routine and grind on some qt's, if you have any money saved up say fuck it and go travel. Do something new! Nuke your old addictive wanting opiate receptors craving the attention of a drug with a barrage of new experiences. Show your stupid primordial brain that you control whatever the fuck you want. Re-establish dominance over yourself. hit the gym, create some endorphins get ripped, go the the beach this summer. Basically look forward to learning something new everyday even if you don't feel it. It's really like Nike, just fucking do it, ignore the feelings of motivation because your brain already has a comprised reward system. Don't listen to how you feel, listen to what you know it the right path.  Time is always going to be your friend and enemy. Don't just sit on reddit and read this shit. Start making a schedule, stick to that motherfucker like a dope fiend on dope. There is really so much to do in life it is almost crippling. So much to do you can't even begin to decide. The world is your damn oyster, open that bitch up and grab the pearls. The anhedonia you are experiencing and lack of pleasure in life is just addiction based, it will passs although PAWS last for a really long time. Don't decide to quit sobriety based off doubt. Just constantly, and make it your mantra that this shit will soon pass. You have to reprogram your brain by showing it that you an have fun and create albeit 1/10 the endorphins via natural high when compared to a opiate high, but like I said before that's the way it has to be. The brain has evolved over hundreds of thousands of years and it doesn't function properly with artificial shit added to it everyday. It takes time to rebalance itself and the only way to do that is to stay in motion. Don't let you feelings take ahold, look to the long term, the best days are still ahead of you I promise, I'm living proof of that. Keep on trucking my friend, 85 days is no joke. And that's it, this has been my rant tailored to you personally\n\nTl;dr - Be like Newton's first law of motion. An object at rest stays at rest unless an outside force acts upon it. You are that force, you have the control whether you want to continue moving forward or stop and start again.\n\nAlso, look at me, it's 3 am and I have to be up for work in 4 hours but I got out of bed and typed all of this up for you because that's how confident I am in knowing your perseverance will pay off :)", "2_Subreddit": "OpiatesRecovery"}], "di0miin": [{"0_Comment Submission": "85 days and struggling", "1_Text": "Im def going to respond to your further inquiries when I get home from work in the afternoon.

Still has side effects though, and naltrexone is used to really combat cravings. So there you go, that little chemical imbalance is why your brain is burning for opiates right now. I would honestly bet like a grand(that I wish I had) that's what's mainly causing your severe cravings right now. See how sensitive our stupid brains are.

I recently relapsed and it was because I stopped exercising. I had intense cravings for 4 months and then I started intense cardio. Cut my cravings down like 75%, it was bearable, it stopped my insane drug dreams too, controlled the overall cravings way more than the fucking vivitrol shot. Also in case you are working at a physical labor job, that doesn\u2019t necessarily cut it for a few reason.

Once you do it once, the seed of habit is planted and just since we are creatures of habit we will often use a 2nd, 3rd, 4th time during those events ad infinity. What I'm saying is you start to reprogram your brain to associate all these activities with using with every new decision that you choose to use in. And by repeating them you condition yourself, much like Pavlov's dogs mouths watering when the bell is rung indicating food. This process specifically occurs in the amygdala (emotional center of the brain) and hippocampus (memory center of the brain). So think about it, you are telling your brain with every choice over the years of your growing addiction that every time we do X( is the activity, even if it's just sitting in your room - it's an association), and Y(is the drug of choice). Your emotional center of the brain and memory center are becoming reprogrammed with every new use further strengthening the addictive process. It's an insidious thing that is almost impossible to be aware of as it happens over such a period of time. The science shows it. We can see differences, physically and chemically in an addicts vs. a non-addicts brain. The good news however is that the brain is quite neuroplastic, meaning you can reverse the habit or coding you have implemented via your choices. The thing is though, it is a long and arduous process. This is the journey of a thousand miles, beginning with a single step. You, once the initial shitty feeling of withdrawal is over, really really have to force yourself to do new things. Anything that breaks the code should help fight the constant bombardment of cravings your addicted brain will send out. You have to actively and in real time, re-teach your brain to live without the drug. This can best be done by exercise (fighting things chemically as you will create your own endorphins to satiate the brain for a time being). But more importantly the long term solution is tackled by doing new things that help form a cycle, a new habit to follow. A habit purely based off sobriety. You will need to start associating X, the activity, with a new variable that is no longer Y, the drug. Now I don't know what the new variable(s) will be for you but I do know that forcing yourself towards a end goal is the answer. Time can be your enemy and your friend. Combat it by doing or creating anything meaningful to fill all the new free time you will have. Re-teach the brain to form dopamine based on sober activities and refuse it of the instant gratification via drug that it was taught beforehand by yourself. You are both the marble and sculptor of this new sculpture of sobriety to be made. You as you have already seen will fail a lot I'm sure, but this is the only way to do it. You are truly in control, the science backs it up. The question is though, can you hold on for one more day, can you chip away the pieces of the addicted brain and smooth over the rough marble edges with your new and quite heavy tool - sobriety based will?\n\ntl;dr - Doing things will help you feel decent quicker.

Please don't view this as disingenuous simply because it's not curtailed entirely to your unique situation. I'm trying to help the best I can by simply explaining the process of what is all going down from my bio-psychology based perspective.  \nAddiction is considered a brain disease. This is because you start out using out of boredom, curiosity, pain, pleasure whatever. The disease of addiction doesn't solidify itself then, but simply plants the seed. It is a process that builds once you start incorporating the choice to use into your daily life. Say you start off only using randomly, then once a month, then every other weekend, then three days a week and finally every day.
