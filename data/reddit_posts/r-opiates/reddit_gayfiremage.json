Besides for physical side effects, Prozac didn't seem to have much effect on my mental state. Lexapro, however, was scary as all hell. I hadn't experienced that level of suicidal thoughts since I was 13 and was forced into a mental ward for a 42 hour suicide watch (18 now). I tapered off with my doctor's help. I honestly rather have the mind numbing depression that I work on every day than medication induced breakdowns and a possible suicide attempt.

I bought some extra strength vitamin D supplements and started going outside more often. I wouldn't say it cured my depression, but it definitely gave me better results than antidepressant medicine in my experience. I feel functional, not super happy or 100 percent normal again, but functional and not horribly bed ridden depressed. Combined with therapy it seems to help some, better than nothing.
