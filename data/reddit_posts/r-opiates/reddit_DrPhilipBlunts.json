She kept him from me the entire first year he was alive.\n\nI've paid $1,500/month in support for over 16 years. Never been late. Never missed a payment.\n\nShe is a horrible person. She's gone on to have three other children from three other men. She's married to another man that hasn't knocked her up yet.\n\nI've always made my children a priority. I'm now married with another 12 year old son.\n\nMy older son finally just moved in with me on Friday. My rule of always making sure he was a priority has worked flawlessly. He chose to live with me.\n\nMy advice to you. Never bad mouth her mother. Never.  \n\nAlways make her a priority. ALWAYS. Be there for her. Even if it's little shit like a school play or a broken heart when she's older. She is the most important thing now, let her always know that. Even if it is inconvenient.

Even if it's supervised visitation, it's better than nothing.\n\nEven if you can't afford a lawyer, go talk to the clerk, ask how you file a petition for visitation. File the paperwork.

Since her family is rich and you aren't, they'll likely have to pay for it.\n\nDo you have a job. Do you have any means to start giving her money? Even $50/month? That'll look good to the guardian.
