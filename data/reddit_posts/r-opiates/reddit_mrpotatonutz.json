Never worked always disappointed. If your long term sub taker the only thing that will breakthrough before a full week is IV H/Fent . Lots of times I had percs or whatever fall in my lap and wasted then trying to lay off for 48-72hours and then take a handful and get nothing. This especially sucks because you will be hurting after 48-72 hours no sub but still not able to get high. When I detoxed this last time off subs it was miserable and 14 days off I got some tabs 10mg and took 2 and felt it. It had been so long I almost cried and was very strict with usage so I didn\u2019t get a habit but of course I\u2019ve gradually slid back down the slippery slope towards going back to the doctor. I REALLY don\u2019t want to be saddled with that sub detox limbo bullshit again. This is just my experience, people are different.
