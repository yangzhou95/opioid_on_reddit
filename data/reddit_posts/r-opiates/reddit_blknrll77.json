I had hit multiple lows and came close to killing myself multiple times because I felt so hopeless. \nI was slamming heroin and meth and my mind was gone. I developed schizophrenia and couldn't take it anymore. \n\n\nI could go on forever about all the shit that led up to it, but it would seriously go on forever. \nI had been to rehab and detoxes before, but each time I knew I wasn't going to stay clean for even an hour after I got it, I knew I didn't really want it. But this last time around, I was HAPPY. Of course I still felt weird and had my moments, but I didn't feel hopeless anymore. I'm 10 months sober, the longest I've ever had since I started using 10 years ago. I used to think I would never live a life without heroin because it would be miserable, but now I have realized my life is miserable when heroin is around.\n\n\nIt's different for everyone, but this is my experience.
