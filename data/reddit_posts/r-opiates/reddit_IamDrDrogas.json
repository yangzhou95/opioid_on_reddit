Just breathing in and out, deep the first couple breaths, then maintain on mid, and clear your head. Do this all the time and you'll get better at it. Initially there's gonna be nothing you can do about thoughts coming in but just label them as what they are (plans, fears, memories, desires) and toss them aside. As you get better you can pull yourself out of situations by relaxing. \n\nBeta blockers and benzodiazepines help. I wouldn't personally want a beta blocker if I'm all that spun though.\n\nAlcohol in a pinch tho it's rough to get down.

What a wonderful day", "1_Text": "Yeah, sure. Honestly, it just sorta built up during the day into doing all that. An old friend of mine was visiting from my old home and he and I went on a lot of (relatively safe) drug benders in college. I don't keep as much stuff on hand anymore so we had to make do with the supplied we had.\n\nI had recently snagged some hexen and re-upped on weed. Alcohol and nicotine are obviously plenty accessible. Already had the 4-aco. My friend had acquired the zalepelon earlier. \n\nTo explain the more obscure substances effects: \n\nEthyl-hexedrone (hexen) is a synthetic cathinone stimulant similar in effect to cocaine. A few of the differences come in the form of longer duration, more causticity on the nose, and some more subtle variations. I'm kinda on the fence as to which I prefer. Hexen is certainly cheaper.\n\n4-aco-dmt is the prodrug to the active ingredient in mushrooms. It's pretty damn impossible to tell the difference between the two on raw dosage other than how quickly stuff hits. Awesome side of it is you can snort it causing it to kick really quick in combination with that ROA having solid bioavailability. Like with all psychs, low doses enhance things quite a bit and full on tripping is its own whole thing. I was somewhere in the middle.\n\nZaleplon is one of the z hypnotics that ostensibly helps you sleep but results in some pretty low-key visuals and a more chilled out yet talkative vibe if you don't go to sleep immediately. It's like a non-evil form of Ambien. Kinda would rather have benzos but oh well.\n\nPretty much all of the substances mentioned were slowly dosed/added on in a way that made sure we were feeling comfortable and not overdoing anything. Started with the hexen since I had just gotten it and wanted to feel it out. Batch I got felt clean for the high and comedown which is a good sign for psychs syngergizing well though I don't really trip much anymore. Weed and moderate alcohol help kinda reign in the psychedelic headspace. The stims made going through lots of beer, weed, and ecig nicotine pretty easy and mixed well with the psych vibes for just chatting with my friend and marathoning video games. \n\nThe Z at the tail end for sleep mellowed things out a touch while making reality feel comfortable and floaty. We pretty much played video games pretty damn late and eventually the sleeping meds made the original post feel like a good idea.\n\nDefinitely not a mix you'll want to do generally. Psychs and amphetamines aren't exactly a common pair and a jacked up balance will land you in a nightmare. However, if you've been around the block and know what you're doing, it's crazy fun. There are actually some psychedelics that are straight up modified amphetamines which let you trip for 16-24 hours (the DoX series). But the mix mentioned let me enjoy tons of focus, cool visuals, some euphoria, extensive but properly limited headspace, and tons of sociability.
