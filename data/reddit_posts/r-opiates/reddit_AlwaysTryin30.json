I know you didn't mean it in a bad way. I also thank the other commentors for sticking up for me even though you didn't mean anything bad. Mostly everyone here is amazing and very supportive. Yeah just having a rough time recently. One of my oldest, closest friends, used me financial wise, and that caused a snowball effect and really hurt my financially more than I could ever afford. I couldn't explain the loss of money to my family without admitting to them about my use. That hasn't gone very well. Two days later I lost my steady job that had a pretty good income.

I don't think there is a way I'll be able to make my rent. End of the week might be an exaggeration as I think I'll get 30 days to clear out but I'm not sure. Rehab seems like it might be the only way I'll get a roof over my head as my parents definitely won't let me into their home. They have the house completely locked up to keep me out and won't talk to me. If I go to rehab they might open back up to me a little bit. My habit used to be very, very heavy, and over the last 6 months to a year I have actually cut my use back substantially. Like enough of a cut back that I'm proud of myself for it, and so are a lot of my friends. I just had a very unlucky last month and a half where it seemed like eveeyrhjng and anythjng that could go wrong did. Idk if im at a point right now where it would be smart to spend all that money on rehab. It would have made a lot more sense back when my habit was really out of control. I'm just not sure what else to do. I can easily say, around January this year, I did not see this being where I would end up by the beginning of April.
