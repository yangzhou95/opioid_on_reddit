You may have better luck asking for klonopin, drs prefer that over Xanax if they\u2019re writing a benzo script because it tends to be abused less and from what I hear withdrawals/addiction risk aren\u2019t as bad as they are with Xanax", "2_Subreddit": "benzodiazepines"}], "dwu04s6": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I'm Eric Hafner, I'm running for U.S. Congress in Portland, Oregon (OR-3).

Creme is harsh and disgusting to me, but ngl I went thru a 2 month or so phase where I actually liked it. Now it literally makes me gag. Fruit is pretty awful too, it\u2019s like vaping cough syrup.
