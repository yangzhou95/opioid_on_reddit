However, not as a kratom alternative, as the don't replicate the effects. I would say that they can possibly aid in reducing the amount of kratom you take. I took the seeds twice this weekend, and both times I used less kratom. I take most my kratom in the night. It helps me unwind and aids me fall asleep. The second time I used the seeds, I did so at night. I had it with a smaller dose of kratom and felt better than I typically do. \n\nI'm curious to know how these seeds mix with other plants/herbs.
