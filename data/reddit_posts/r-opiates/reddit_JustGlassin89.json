He's connected to a prison gang, I don't know of he's going to be selling inside and I believe when we talking about him going away months ago he said he doesn think he will be selling inside.\n\nLike you said he could be leading buyers but I doubt it because he isn't going in for drug charges, he's going in for something else and snitching isn't with this dude cause he's in the game. That sounds stupid to say that he wouldn't snitch but with his connections and how loyal he is I don't see him turning, especially on his buyers, if anything it would be his suppliers, and even then he just wouldn't do that.\n\nI think he's really trying to get rid of all his product before he goes in and get ad much dough as possible so he can start his sentence with some cash which ultimately gives him power. I know he'll be reconnecting with his prison gang so I really doubt anymore he's trying to set anyone up or cooperate with law enforcement. That wouldn't be smart on his end because the last thing you want is paper trail of you turning people in when you're going into prison surrounded by the real gang life inside, ya know? \n\nI don't know, maybe I'm just ignorant as fucked as I've never even been to jail in my life lol.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dus240f": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Looking for advice (Whay would you do?)", "1_Text": "Oh, without a doubt.

To tell you the truth I went to a music store and bought some guitar strings and a couple picks and while I was walking out I said you know what, let me look at the guitars you got and walked into the acoustic room. I didn't leave with anything because I was crunched for time as the family and I had some errands and shopping to do but I'm doing back tomorrow or this week and am going to spend some more time trying them out and will be buying a new guitar to treat myself.\n\nWill make my brain release so much more dopamine and for a way longer time than some dope could ever do. It's been a couple years since I bought a new guitar and I think I kind of deserve it especially for staying straight even after today :).\n\nAgain, thank you for your kind words, bro it really means a lot and best of luck to you in your journey and you can definitely do it or continue to do it if you already have been on the clean train.

We boarder Mexico (hope that's not too specific for the mods) so we got plenty of drugs but I've never seen dboys on corners or anything like that. Plus all my dealers were either white or Mexican, like Paisa Mexicans. I mean, there's hood's but I guess they aren't your typical hoods, it's hoods that are full of Illegal Mexicans or legal Mexicans that are below the poverty line and I've never seen Mexicans standing on a corner hollering out if you good or are looking.\n\nI guess they think it's smarter to not do that and would rather deal from their pad or drive to you, but obviously there's a huge risk driving with anything on you and that's how they all get busted. Pulled over by the cops and they're done. The dude that is going to prison was pulled over but his girl stashed the boy and they found some foil and tooters and he would have been fucked right there but his girl said they were hers and since she wasn't on probation or anything they charged her with a misdemeanor and towed the car cause he was driving without a valid license.\n\nSo point is that's even as sketchy as sealing on a corner.
