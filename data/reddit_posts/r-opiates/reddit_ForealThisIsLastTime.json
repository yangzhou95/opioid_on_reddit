Even a few hours per week is enough to use.\n\nLPT2: Also consider joining a club/group related to your profession that meets once per week or month. For added bonus, try to get a leadership position. But even just membership can go on your resume to fill in or \u2018help explain\u2019 work gaps.\n\nWhile doing either of those, you\u2019ll also meet like-minded people who might be able to help you get a new job. They\u2019ll learn your work ethics and hopefully like you, then a referral can go a long way. Networking really helps in job hunting and knowing the right people can open doors.\n\nI got my last 4 jobs by knowing a current employee, who recommended me to the Manager or Director, which got me an interview set up. Then if you can interview competently you\u2019ll normally get an offer. Companies typically like referrals from good employees because they want more good employees like that and it saves them recruiting costs.\n\nSorry for the wall of text at the end.
