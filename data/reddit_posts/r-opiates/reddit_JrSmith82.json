I made no attempt to conceal my dope/clear. Just threw the baggies in my wallet & it was fucking money across all airport security, both nations. I was scared when I crossed border on foot & the dogs (those are 100% not bomb dogs @ border) were itching to go in my direction lol. But this dude on Forensic Files threw off police dogs using pepper (mf murdered old ladies in the same apartment complex, same month, same way... stole their VCRs... yeesh) so if it's not a kilo I'm sure a little pepper will just help you act cool about that measly couple grams no one gives a fuck about anyway apparently.

Bill, the \"Dating Daddy Guardian dude\", etc. all have an effortless way of making women feel uncomfortable. These bits wouldn't be funny without these dudes; when asked to reflect on what I found funny about these things, I'd say I'm laughing more at the guys and their antiquated views on gender than the women feeling uncomfortable, but there's no denying that particular element is present. However, simply ignoring that these social dynamics exist and \"shoving them under the carpet\" so to speak doesn't exactly move this conversation forward either. Some men are assholes and treat women this way; putting them in situations that bring this behavior of theirs to light places the joke on them, in my opinion at least. \n\nThe thing with Maci was entirely consensual, and it would seem to me at least that the joke is intended to be on Nathan's character (though admittedly using a woman to propel it forward, but what bit hasn't used \"people\" of all genders/races/ages/social classes especially! in their rawest forms to propel their respective segments on the show forward) \n\nI will say that it strikes me as entirely ridiculous to compare Nathan with Harvey Weinstein & Louis C.K., however.

I'm also male, so it's also clearly not my place to comment on whether certain segments with women on the show are offensive, but I guess I was initially reluctant to say so because it's clear (to me at least) that the intent in the segments I described wasn't to condone the power dynamics, but instead call attention to a)their existence & b)the ridiculous behavior of people holding such views. \n\nAt the end of the day, intentions are pretty irrelevant to any resulting state of affairs, so I guess I'm just disappointed that people can feel this way about the show.
