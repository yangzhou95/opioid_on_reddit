So he calls his dude to come bring it. a while later my friend comes up to me and is like yo dude is gonna be here in 10 minutes with the coke give me the money ($600). i look at my friend and im like bro i dont have the money yet my refund check is coming tomorrow...my friend is like wtf bro this ghetto ass nig (who is known to have a short temper and carries a pistol everywhere) just drove 45 minutes to bring this half zip of coke and is gonna be pissed when he gets here and i dont have the money. so thank god my boy is like i have cash in my room (he sold a shit ton of molly) i can front you the cash cuz i dont want dude to pistol whip you lol.\n\nDude comes and we do the deal all is fine and i end up passing out again. i wake up the next morning from being completely blacked out on the couch, in a town 20 minutes car ride from where i remember being when i was drinking with no clue how i get there. then i reach into my pocket and there is a huge bag of coke and im like wtf!! i go out back to find my boy tending to his weed plants and he tells me the whole story. i was so fucking thankful cuz i didnt even know this dude that well, i had been introduced to him only like a couple months prior from a mutual friend and would just buy molly from him every once in a while but its not like we were good friends, so i was really surprised he was down to front me $600 cuz for all he knew i was shit faced drunk and just saying i was getting money.\n\ni think he just didnt want a murder going down in his living room if i had told coke dude that i didnt have the money after he drove all the way out there haha.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dsogpfh": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Does anyone know what happened to me last night?", "1_Text": "you probably just missed or some of it was leaking out. ive hit veins on my legs before where i was getting a good register but it burned hella bad and left a good size bruise for a few days after that.\n\nive hit an artery before many different times and the burning feeling was so bad i dont think you would be able to keep pushing it in...", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dsra72g": [{"0_Comment Submission": "This + Shameless season 8 \ud83d\ude0f", "1_Text": "ya i agree the latest episodes ive watched have been pretty bad compared to older seasons.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dswbiel": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Decisions: get a $90/g uncut BTH or 2g of $50/g regular BTH?", "1_Text": "Depends on how good the \"normal\" stuff is.
