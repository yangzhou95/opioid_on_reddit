My reply would be as follows:\n\nIf ultimately i am self medicating my depression with opiates, what is wrong with me continuing down that path, so long as I use them with respect and see the situation for what it Is?\n\nThe thought that I and many others have vis a vis \"I'll never be normal/happy/content without this substance\" isn't simply because of the neurobiology that results from long term use, it is also due to the original mental issue that made such use appealing in the first place...\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I have dealt with my depressive symptoms/nature in many different ways, some legal, others not...i can honestly say that Methadone has been MUCH more efficacious than, say, Zoloft...shouldnt I be allowed to pursue the treatment I find most effective?\n\n(This is not to say that denial doesn't exist in addiction...it obviously does.

People who are well adjusted, stable, and of a high enough socio-economic status may still become opiate addicts, this is true.  But in my personal experience/observation, sustained recovery and abstinence for this cohort is *usually* much easier to achieve.  \n\nAnd why shouldn't this be so?  They are already high enough in their hierarchy of needs that what we call happiness should be easier to come by for them.  If the only thing preventing you from enjoying your life as a well connected member of the elite is a misadventure with heroin, then the removal of the drug from your life once it becomes problematic is akin to the excision of a psychological/spiritual kidney stone; no matter how painful the process of removal is, it has every chance of being brief.  In other words, this is why my friends who come from wealthier, more stable backgrounds tend to view their heroin/opiate abuse as a mere footnote in their biographies.  They have a lot more with which to potentially define themselves.\n\nMost of us are not that fortunate.  As William S Burroughs said: \"The idea that anyone can use drugs and escape a horrible fate is anathema to these idiots\" (We can assume he means prohibitionists of all stripes)\n\nSo, I feel that if we are to take a real look at the opiate crisis in this country, we not only have to look at why people use these chemicals in the first place (ie what problem or pain are they addressing?), but we have to examine if their self determined treatment is effective.  \n\nBecause, and i feel this might be the most important aspect of what I am saying here, let us not kid ourselves...We can pretend that everyone in the world can access these psychological treatments you describe, but there is a stubborn and ruthless economic factor involved here.  Most people who can even afford psychological care cannot afford the type of intensive Cognitive Behaviorial Therapy or other approaches that might be needed to address a post-addiction individual in the way you describe.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that drugs might never be a preffered treatment in and of themselves, but I also believe that we must offer some treatment to those who need it.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwxku6j": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Theres still hope for us all.", "1_Text": "It works, but the side effects are almost as bad as withdrawal so there isn't really a point.
