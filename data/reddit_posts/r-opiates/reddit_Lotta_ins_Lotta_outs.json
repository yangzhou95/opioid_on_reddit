Sounds like you've got a tough journey like so many, but opiates will only make it impossible instead of tough. Seems like you've got somd family resources. Be grateful and take advtantage. Get as much help as possible with the mental health. Those stamp bags are Russian roulette. It's sad but if you keep using one of those bags will kill you eventually. Life is great on it's own. Good luck with the BF but he isn't the end all be all. Set your goals and don't let him compromise those.

I really respect the 12 step program. It's a great life/way of living to strive for. One thing I dislike is the emphasis on clean time. Obviously any amount is amazing and congrats on your tag. I just don't like that a relapse puts you back at the start bc in reality it doesn't if you don't let it. I'm not knocking the program AA has done so much for me and I've met the kindest people. But imo it's so much more nuanced than the big book. Either way clean time is great. Opiates are the ultimate tease. They give you everything you need but it costs you everything you have.

Only difference is the woman I love knows of my disease and keeps me under her thumb. It's not perfect but it keeps me from going off the deep end. The last year I kept it a secret I probably spent 75k on blues and coke. And I made the dick joke cuz I hadnt had a boner in months either haha. In recovery they say you gotta feel all the pain before you surrender. I'm not yet surrendered but I love my girl/life more than the drugs and it's enough to allow me to walk the line for now.
