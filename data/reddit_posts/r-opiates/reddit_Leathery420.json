I was part of the maintenance team. Though being just out of highschool I basically just hauleded out/gutteded aparments before renos, and notified people that the exterminator would becoming to deal with roaches/bed bugs so they needed to move their furniture, and remove light fictures so he could lay down traps, and ect. They owned a couple of motels, and 8 or 10 apartment buildings. \n\n\nWhile I never did much at the motels besides move furniture, and AC units in, and out. Anyway on the aparment side there were a few notable cases. Most NSFW moment would be dude fucking his girlfriend louldy in the other room while I recaulked his bathtub instead of asking me to come back some other day. I finished up, and got out.\n\n There was an elderly resident who died, and had sat in the hot apartment in july for 2 or 3 weeks, and thankly I never needed to enter while he was inside because the stench was unbareable. I was there when the coroners wheeled him out though, and Ill remember that smell until its toppeded. \n\nThen there was another unit where I had to tell the guy the exterminator was coming, but when he showed me it was evident he wouldnt be able to do much. The guy was on mental disability, and barely cleaned it if at all. Black mold was on basically every surface, as well as bed bugs. His case worker ended up coming, and they took him to the hospital to check him out until they could find someplace for him to stay. The room needed to be completely gutteded, it was a biological hazard. I refused to help in that as I was making a half dollar over minimum wage, and I already didnt feel great about needing to step into some of these other units. I quit a week or two as most other other maintenance staff had in the weeks prior, and weeks after I did. I found out they ended up selling the aparments from a local news, and the article said it had been getting even worse. Which is pretty nuts considering we hauled out like 8-10 bed bug infested matresses.

We are pretty overdue for a large war between then, and now if history has much to say about it. Who knows maybe we will have left earth, and people could get a wicked view of the nuclear hell fire on earth from orbit. Though in reality they will probably be dropped before then if they are to be deopped. \n\nNot to be a buzz kill and get political, but that shit in syria doesnt look to be getting much better after ISIS kicked the bucket, because all the groups were focused on them are now fighting each other. Turkey is now getting involved so they may crush the kurds while they are tied up and take the land in syria they captured as, and likley in Iraq too. Then that leaves both the Syrians, and Iraqis with two options give them the land, or fight them. Given the history of the region it likely wont be the first option. Then there is the possability of other countries currently fighting insurgencies getting worse to the point of civil war seen in Syria, and Iraq.

How did it go?", "1_Text": "Used too be pretty heavily against religion because of the community I grew up in. Was full of people who used it as a reason bring others down. I got out, and met athiests who did the same thing,  as well religous people who used it more as a personal moral code than a reason to judge folks for their views. Those experiences helped me see the ignorance in my ways. While I'm still not religious, I can appreciate others beliefs. I think the lyrics \"If your god is a judge or a jailer,\nI\u2019m still an atheist.\nBut I try to have faith in the things that will happen;\nI get saved from myself when i do.\nSo maybe \u201cgod\u201d isn\u2019t the right word, but I believe in you.\" sum up most of my views on that subject pretty well. Religion can be great its, when its used by people, and organizations to control others that bothers me. \n\nI also grew up in a community that was pretty against firearms as well. Though when I got out, and met more firearms enthusists myself, and read up on the laws instead of just beliving what the community or media said about them I saw that most of what they said was borderline untrue. I get some people really dont like them, and thats 100% ok, but please see for yourself before you condemn them. The people in firearms community were for the most part some of the safest, and most peace loving people I've ever met. Though If I just belived what I was told about them I'd never have found that out.", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dw6v536": [{"0_Comment Submission": "TIFU by trying to look up the movie 'Moonlight' and inadvertently exposing my entire family (including kids) to gay black porn.", "1_Text": "Oh man lol.

Bethesda saved the beloved IP just to get rid of more, and more of what made it fallout. Then when fans want to recreate FO3, and NV in FO4s engine because FO4 isnt a good fallout game. They shoot those projects because they dont want mods that use the audio assets from FO3 or NV, even if the mod author makes it so the person using them owns a copy of said games. This is also with no intentions of working on a new fallout game for some time too, so its not like they are doing it on grounds of cauaing poor sales to future games. It wasnt enough that they made Obsidian rush NV because of skyrim, but then they also refuse to let Obsidian develop another FO game incase it makes them look even worse. If they can take only the things they got right in FO4, and none of the bad then FO5 will be great. Though if bethesda's previous choices are anything to go on that likely wont happen.
