They are originally from Belgium and Schipperke means \u201clittle captain.\u201d They were bred to guard ships and catch mice! My boy just guards me. Constantly. He is extremely loyal to me and everything he does is for me. It breaks my heart to think that someone just didn\u2019t want him after three years because he is so much more than a little dog, he is a loving little being. He sits by the door all day and waits for me to come home from work, and once I\u2019m back, he does everything with me and I take him everywhere. He even comes to work with me often. They are know for being really smart and having a really weird/distinct  personality which he DEFINITELY has. He is super goofy and makes weird noises all the time. He is super high energy, too, so we take him to the park all the time. My favorite thing about him is he is like actually my own little teddy bear. He lets me use him as a pillow and we cuddle up every night. I got him when I was 18 and extremely depressed. He was a lot to handle for a long time, because it seemed like his old family just ignored him and couldn\u2019t keep up with him, but we both learned so much about each other in the first year. He is my whole universe and has saved me from going back into depression because I know he needs me. And I need him.

The last time we went there was some chick with a terrible dog and she was just sitting on the bench recording it and laughing. Her dog ran up to my Schipperke and knocked him on his back. She kept recording and laughing, so I picked up my dog, told her that it\u2019s not fucking funny, and we grabbed our other dog and left.

I\u2019m a girl, so I don\u2019t completely understand how you feel, but I had no friends at your age and no guy would ever talk to me. I spent the first 16 years of my life by myself. I was super upset that I never fit in and put all of that energy towards hating everyone else. If I could go back and change that mindset, I would, because it only made everything worse. Rejection really fucking sucks. It\u2019s fucking horrible, but not everyone is like that. Try to brush it off and not let it warp your views on the world.
