I'm hoping that after your friend pulls through, he will verify your story to them and stick up for you. I doubt that the police will seek you out. It's already on record that you saved him and were free to go after the incident. What puzzles me is why they would even suggest that you'd be the logical choice to drop the ID off.

I didn't have faith this concept for many years but it seems that once sparks start flying...  There's no turning back. One bit of advice.

There is a blind bonus to this (providing that you are self confident and patient)... That you get to know the person much better via straight up conversation rather than worrying about clothes hair and make up for example. You're getting one on one time and there are freedoms of asking questions that you'd otherwise be more hesitant to ask if you were out on dates.
