Funny ones and serious ones. All are greatly appreciated lol. I\u2019ll get it out of my head and cut her off for good this time. I did a couple times and told her off but like an addict I come back apologizing three-four days later.  I will not reach out for her anymore and if she\u2019s out with her boy or dope is still around I will not support. \n\nThat\u2019s pretty much saying she won\u2019t ever have me as a friend anymore. Sucks. But I will not let her in my life again... One small detail that I left out was that she also tried to get me hooked on the devil\u2019s cocktails. I did a shot and never picked it up again after. I wanted to see her reaction.. yet.. She actually encouraged me to do a few more days to really know what addiction is like... that should have been the biggest red flag.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwtx2wy": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Prolong the life of a user", "1_Text": "Hahaha, \nHi nosecandiez!  \nI already cut ties with her. Sent her a long message saying: \n\n\u201cHey X, I'm gonna be real with you. There's no possible way this is going to end up good for me. One - you're either going to set me up to get robbed by this boy, and since he has a long history of being so much of a fuck up I'm going to end up dead unintentionally. Two, you're gonna exhaust my resources to the day you end up dead. So I don't think I'm the best to have around right now in this point in time for you. If you decide you want to get clean, say a day you wake up and randomly want to say no more, I will be there for you. Before that, I can't help you anymore than emotionally supporting you. That is all. I hope you know i have best intention since the beginning in wanting to patch up your relationship with your family. But I have to look after my own too. I miss you and I am glad to have seen you recently.\u201d\n\nMy brain is still processing denial and in the process of bargaining right now. I\u2019m in the \u201cwhat if\u201d stage... eventually she will be history. In the meantime, I\u2019m just curious if it is ever possible to be in a healthy relationship with a user.
