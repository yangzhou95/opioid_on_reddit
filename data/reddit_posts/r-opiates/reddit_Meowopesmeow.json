Kratom doesn't get you high like oxy, it's a great plant though, it's cheap and super useful. Takes the edge off though right...I only just tried it a couple of months ago as it's illegal here in Australia, but I found a super cheap plug who ships from Indonesia and doesn't gaf about our laws. Still playing around with kratom, hopefully long term I can move onto it full time for pain management and get off oxy. While these days I'm a functional addict I wasn't at the start. It's taken kind of staring down into the abyss several times to figure out what works for me and what doesn't. Every time it's gotten out of hand it's been from me buying street opiates, it's a good example of why opiates should be fkn legal. Addicts everywhere would have so much better quality of life and so much less harm when drugs are affordable and pharmaceutical quality. I've again over ranted, so high, lol \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nI hope you get a script, some advice if u want on what to say? For me, I really had to get across just how much pain I was in round the clock, and this was not a lie for me because I am in like 7/10 pain always unless I have opiates. Anyways I pretty much had to say this, and you have to be very careful saying this and phrase it right \"The pain completely runs my life, I can't live like this, I want to live with all my heart for my family and myself but if I cannot fine any pain relief that works I just can't live like this for much longer and I will end up killing myself. I'm not depressed and not suicidal but I cannot fathom living like this for another 50 years.\" All of it true too and I was kinda crying in he doctors office. Crying doesn't hurt especially if you're a guy. This was after he cycled me through about 20 different media in the past year. Then u ever so slowly work your way from Tramadol, to oxy", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dvtsl6p": [{"0_Comment Submission": "600 hulk bars xanax", "1_Text": "Jfc. Yeh see if kind of enjoy Xanax recreationally but for the most part I just use benzos as prescribed. The only time I take tons is in WD or coming down from stims. I've always been terrified that if I take more than a couple of bars something like what you just said will happen. I'll stick to abusing opiates, I don't want a handcuff allergic reaction. I'm curious, when u go to hospital like that and you're dependant on opiates will they give u something to maintain with like methadone or do they just let u get sick?
