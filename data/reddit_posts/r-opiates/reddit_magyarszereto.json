It is very effective for our local smokable preparation of heroin base and base cocaine, as its trail runs quite clear. For stuff like tar I suppose the method changes, in pictures it seems to burn a lot and leave a wide trail. I have seen media and read of people just smoking in any direction on the foil.\n\nI suppose I recommend this method if you know your gear is not cut to shit, as in this way you can always pick up any h you left behind on the foil and join it back to the main droplet of stuff everytime you run it past.\n\nBut yeah, I think in any case the direction doesn't really matter, if you're smoking in good conditions.\n\nEnjoy, the best way to find your own personal form of beetle chasing is practising a lot, when you find your innate talent it is a gift to the soul.
