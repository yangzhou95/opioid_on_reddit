Crush the tablets into a fine powder. Minimize powder loss.\n\nTip: Put your tablets in a Ziplock bag so you don't lose any!\n2. Dissolve the powder into warm water. Get hot water from the tap (NOT too hot!), as boiling water may destroy the opioid. Put the water in a container/bowl with a wide surface area, which allows the mixture to cool faster. Add the powder you crushed to about 1/2 cup water.\n\nTip: Its better to have too much water than not enough.\n3. Let the mixture sit and cool to room temperature on the counter for about 10-20 minutes. Stir it every few minutes until it is completely dissolved.\n\nTip: Don't rush this! Go watch tv or something if you have nothing else to do but watch the mixture dissolve!\n4. Put the container/mixture into the freezer until cold. No need for a lid on the container. Leave it sit until it is extremely cold to the touch. Do not let it freeze or ice up! This process might take 20-25 minutes.\n\n5. Filter your mixture. Use a pre wet coffee filter, cheesecloth, or even an aeropress. A handkerchief might work as well if you don't have any of those. Put the filter over the top of a cup and secure it with a rubber band or tape. SLOWLY pour the mixture into the filtered cup. Do not pour in too much water or touch the filter, as you may break it and have to redo the filtering.\n\n6. When it appears like the filter is done dripping into the cup and there is nothing left to filter, you will then have a dense, marshmallow-like substance. You may choose to squeeze the contents of the old filters through a new filter to save any remaining moisture. Careful not to spill! You may also add more water to the marshmallow mash and re-filter it, but this step isn't necessary. As the APAP/ibuprofen/aspirin begins to clog the filter ..even if is carefully decanted you might speed things up by doing two separate filtrations simultaneously.\n\n7. Bottoms up! Drink your mixture and throw away the APAP/ibuprofen/aspirin; most should have been successfully removed. The remaining concoction might be really bitter, so try mixing it with something sweet.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwcpt8i": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What's Happening to Our Sub?", "1_Text": "hes probably been too busy finger banging girls in the blue boat", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwcqc15": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Imagine a society where drug users of all kinds are viewed as the lowest of the low, so low they aren't even considered humans anymore.
