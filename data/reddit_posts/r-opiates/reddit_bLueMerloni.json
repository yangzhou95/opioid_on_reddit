At the assisted living place I used to have my great aunt and uncle in, they both would have their medication given to them daily by staff because they would forget if it were left up to them.  The nurses came in and give it to them out of a wax paper envelope thing with a similar sticker on it as shown in your picture.   If you think there\u2019s a possibility someone made an honest mistake and a patient was left without their meds you should see if you can correct the situation.
