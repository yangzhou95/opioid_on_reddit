Found this in an old bag -praise the lord- that came up north with me from Florida. Florida dope is shit for the most part and dumb expensive on top of that. So nice to be in the northeast again and getting buns for a 1/3 of the price you'd pay down there. Too bad the coke is twice as expensive up here. \nLooks like I was just doing lines but ended up banging that and got real nice.
