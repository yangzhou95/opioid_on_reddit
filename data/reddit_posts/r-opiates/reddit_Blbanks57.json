Was always against pills and powders because I have an older brother who completely fucked his life up because of them. But then the only girl I'll ever love killed herself which really affected me. I mean one of the last times I saw her I told her to get a gun and shoot me because I was already so depressed and she said no ud have to kill me first. So after that I was like fuck this I'm done trying to do the right thing and wanted to try everything. I never even tried percs or vics first I just went straight to dope.

When we were younger, before she hurt me, we always fantasized about buying a house and having kids. We used to look at real estate listings for the house we wanted lol. He still lives on through ur kids don't ever forget that. Try to think if that's what he would have wanted, for his kids to grow up with neither their mom or dad, I highly doubt it. And yeah if u cared about him as much as I did her, u do have a long road ahead of u. Ur probably going to develope coping mechanisms like I have. A while ago, I started fiddling with whatever it was I had in my pockets, my keys, lighter, some coins, whatever. I still do it but now it leads me grasping on it firmly. As if I was holding her hand, like we did when I was driving or when we were walking down the street together. When I do that, it makes me feel a little bit better. I almost smile.
