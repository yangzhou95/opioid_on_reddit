You likely think I am paranoid but I am not.  A few years ago my young (2ish) nephew thought it would be funny to wake me up by climbing on the bed and waking me with a swift kick to the dick. Did the state in which a man\u2019s appendage is commonly found to be at in the AM help to alleviate or aggravate the pain I found myself in? I still do not know. However, I do know now that I am very capable of murder, even of a small child. My plan to follow through with such a thing only thwarted by the fact that small children are very quick and elusive and mostly made of substance that is sticky when  inappropriate and also slippery when inappropriate.
