It just doesn't sit well. \n\nImagine a Palestinian jam about being trapped in their own land being sung by an Israeli dude. That Israeli has nothing to do with the political situation and may even oppose what his country is doing. But to cover that song is ... icky. Hell he could even write his own song about the situation and it'd be totally cool. But that's the Palestinian song about the pain of their people. It may be enjoyed by anyone, but it is not for Israelis to sing.\n\nPlease don't let me discourage you. You did a great job and it's way more than I've done.

I'm really so sorry for your loss and the guilt you have to carry around.

I'm not sure it's ever going to go away entirely. But I'm able to enjoy life and laugh and find good things. So does the pain ever stop? I really don't know. Maybe not. Sometimes I don't want it to. Sometimes it's because I don't want to stop missing her and sometimes it's because I feel like I deserve it.\n\nShe made her own choices though, just as your boyfriend made his. He had an addiction just like you have one. It's not your fault, but it will definitely feel that way for a while. Don't off yourself and give it time - it's only been ten days.
