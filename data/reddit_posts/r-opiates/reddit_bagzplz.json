You want this. I can read how much you want this. You can get better. You have the support of the people you love. That just makes it a little bit easier.\n\nMy suggestion is to let your fiance baby the shit out of you during the first week of your taper. Those bad days can be made so much better with a set of clean sheets, a nice shower, proper nutrition and hydration, and a shoulder to cry on when things get rough. Get yourself some daily vitamins. Get as much sleep as you can. Keep yourself bathed, take care of yourself, do things that make you feel better, and take a bit of time every day to get some sunlight and move your lazy, sweaty, shaky butt. \n\nI've had a ton of success with B12.

The first time I took it, I shit you not, I couldn't tell if clouds moved away from the sun or the B12 had legit made the world more saturated.\n\nIt turns your pee a weird color (which is normal) so don't be alarmed. It makes food taste better, so I would take it in the mornings before making breakfast. That helped a lot with my lack of appetite (plus weed) when I was in my first few weeks of sobriety. \n\nB12 really helps you deal with stress. The entire stretch of me using it for the first time, it was like night and day. I swear that shit is a miracle vitamin. My stress levels were at a ridiculously controllable level- something that was totally foreign to me. I have anxiety and depression issues, but the B12 really helped me reach a baseline mentally that I hadn't touched in a really long time. Granted, it won't stay a miracle vitamin for long. You'll get used to the effects and it won't feel as drastic of a change after a while, but it's honestly amazing.\n\nI didn't panic. I didn't have anxious breakdowns. I could manage my daily schedule without a feeling of impending doom. I could focus more on what was important (cleaning, work, friendships). I got clean, I took my B12, and I made it 50 days clean. I *HIGHLY* suggest people give it a shot even though it's a little bit of an investment. I seriously think that tapering with suboxone, moving to kratom for a bit if you really need the mood boost, and taking B12 with a general daily multivitamin will make getting clean a lot more comfortable.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwpq32x": [{"0_Comment Submission": "2 years", "1_Text": "I'm so proud <3 What's the biggest change in your mental health at two years compared to the day where you decided you needed to do something about your problem?", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwpq973": [{"0_Comment Submission": "In regards to comments not showing up on threads", "1_Text": "I'm gonna riot.
