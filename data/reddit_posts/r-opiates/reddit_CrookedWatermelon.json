Obviously the guys aren\u2019t saints or anything but given that Michaud owns CA and NC, I feel like they\u2019re both in a position where there\u2019s not much they can do about any of it. Based on the way some of this read, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they did try but got shut down because Mike can put them on the chopping block just as easily as anyone else.

I don\u2019t know if I can bring myself to completely stop watching NC because I really do love that show. The only excuse I have for it is that I\u2019m choosing to not put as much blame on Doug and Rob as a lot of other people are because of the fact that Mike basically owns them so they really don\u2019t have anymore power than the other producers to put a stop to his behavior. That being said, I\u2019ve definitely lost respect for them due to some of their actions outside of the shit Mike does. The only thing I really just can\u2019t understand about any of this is why in the fuck would Doug give that piece of shit the Nostalgia Critic IP? I understand letting someone buy the majority of the company of CA, but to give up the actual IP of their flagship program/character is so incredibly stupid to me. If Doug could somehow get back full ownership of NC and completely cut Mike out of the picture, he might be able to salvage whatever good will he has left. It really sucks to have to sit here and watch them be forced to ride a sinking ship and have their reputations destroyed mostly due to someone else (though their own actions aren\u2019t doing much to help them in that regard either). I do think Doug and Rob can build their reputations back up if they can separate themselves from Michaud. I\u2019m really hoping they can manage to get themselves away from him and still be able to make NC episodes.
