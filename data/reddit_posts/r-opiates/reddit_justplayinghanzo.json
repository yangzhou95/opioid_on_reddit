This time I honestly had some demons I wanted to face and I went in head first with a 500 ug trip. I had 6 xans in case it got to be too much to handle and a friend there who was also tripping on 100 ug. We smoked weed on the come up and it was euphoric as hell. We laughed for a couple hours before all the psychedelic head fuck started to kick in. Minutes later I had a 10 second panic attack while listening to a song that I had heard in my first trip but after that I was fine for the most part\n\nEven though I was able to enjoy myself though I would occasionally feel an almost menacing presence. The head fuck and visuals were even stronger than I expected I eventually laid down and closed my eyes and had completely unreal CEVS. The whole time I felt a blanket of euphoria all over me and the more it consumed me something weird started to happen. The drug literally started stripping my identity away. Eventually everything that made me myself was just no longer there. I was simply observing the world through a vessel that was not me. I wouldn't even necessarily I was observing the world because I it wasn't me, It was something else entirely. At some point o returned, I couldn't tell you when.Then my dumbass forgot about the xans and stayed up til 11 am. I still don't know what to make of it tbh with you. \n\nBut if you do go for a second trip just make sure your mindsets right and your in a good environment. I kept myself in a good mindset this time by refusing to be scared and always reminding myself that it was a drug. I saw demons and laughed in there faces. And if some shit started happening that I didn't enjoy I didn't let it get me down too much and took some advice someone gave and just recognized that it was just a part of my trip that was pissing me off a bit and it'll get better quickly.
