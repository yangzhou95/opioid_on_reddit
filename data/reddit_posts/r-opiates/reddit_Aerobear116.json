Favorites? Least favorites? Why?", "1_Text": "Currently 9 months off opioids and besides drinking I haven\u2019t done any drugs in over 2 months. Messed around with Eth(an)ol at 11, and drank coffee around the same time. Met Mary Jane at 13 and she\u2019s been my most consistent friend, always there for me. Had my flings with percs and xans at 15, xans and I have forgettable nights every now and then still. At 16 I had met Molly, and we\u2019d hippy flip and candy flip a couple times per year til my mid-20s. Hung out with White girls at a couple parties at 17 but they were too fast for me, and they started me on cigs. Met Rox(i)anne who I thought was the love of my life at 18 in college. We were tight(even with me banging Addy 2 weeks a year).  Then I ran off with her sister Opana at 22 and it was absolute bliss. When she ran out on me I rebounded with Heroin at 24. Finally broke it off with that toxic chick at 26, she was almost straight fent by then, the short rush I had with her never made up for all the pain she caused me. \n\nLooking back if I had to choose, my favorites would be Opana, she still has my heart and Mary Jane for always being there, sucks I don\u2019t get to see her much with my new job. But I think in phases of my life there were things that were my favorite. Molly and going to hookah lounges at one point of my life was the coolest thing then I(fucking ridiculously stupidly) thought blacking out from alcohol and xans was cool but if we\u2019re talking solo then my first two choices.
