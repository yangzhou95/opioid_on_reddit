No, you'll reach right for the needle/foil/pipe/grindr/etc. to stave off the already rapidly encroaching sense of guilt and worthlessness that accompanies any perceived failure on your part, be it small (like boiling an egg and breaking it accidentally) or big (like finally picking up that unpaid bill from months ago, you know, the one where they're threatening to take your stuff?
