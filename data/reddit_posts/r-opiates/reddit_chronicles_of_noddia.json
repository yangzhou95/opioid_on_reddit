But it is what you make of it. For a long time I kept using because I thought that I was happier high than sober. The reality was that was just my addiction tricking me into using again. I guess maybe everybody is different, but for me as soon as opiates enter my life EVERYTHING because drastically more stressful and just overall worse. It might be fun like the first or second time, but after that it just becomes shit. Everybody I care about turns from me, and my financial issues grow 10-fold. It's like, no matter how shitty life was when I was sober, it becomes that much shittier when I'm not. So it's kind of a lose-lose in that regard. But in trying to be mostly sober (with a few hiccups here and there) I have noted some things that definitely help. Exercise is a big one. Getting in the gym and sweating every day or cardio makes me feel a lot better and less depressed. Talking to people helps, like having a counselor or whatever. I think for established long term sobriety though you need to have cemented in your brain that no matter how bad things are sober, they WILL get worse if you start using again. But that's just my take on it, I suppose.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}]}], "1_submissions": [{"7nb7vu": [{"0_Title": "Happy New Years.
