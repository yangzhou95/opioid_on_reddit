Then once you've scraped the (semi-dried) O off the outer capsule, cut the stalk a few inches below the pod and hang them up to dry for a few days. You'll know they're done drying once they're fully hardened and seeds start spilling out everywhere (definitely put something underneath to catch them or you'll have a mess haha). The tea wont be quite as potent since you've already removed some of the opium, but there's definitely still enough goodies left in there to make it worthwhile :) I updated the image link with another picture for reference: \n  https://imgur.com/a/sdmcC", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwmp5qn": [{"0_Comment Submission": "New to Reddit!
