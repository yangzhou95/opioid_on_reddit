About two weeks in I found out it was Heroin, and for whatever reason, didnt care. \n\nFast forward to February of \u201816, me and Iv had become best friends but had stopped using H for about a year and a half. \n\nIv and I meet this girl named Hannah who was completely absorbed in her heroin addiction. \n\nLong story short, ever since then I\u2019ve been a junkie, in recovery (2 1/2 weeks max), and have been struggling SO FUCKING HARD ever since.
