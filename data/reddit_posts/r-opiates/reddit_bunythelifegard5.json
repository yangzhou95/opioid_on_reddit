If I had chronic pain that i couldnt handle I would probably use some killer bud instead of opiates, and im not knocking the alcoholic who chose daily marijuanna as a much more functional option as I have some family who iv witnessed do this successful. However, a plain old addict shouldnt use anything everyday and the human brain does not function properly on any substance especially using daily. The brains chemical levels get all fuckd even from marijuanna. Hence why your not hungry for a month or dont sleep well when you quit pot. Not to mention dreams are an extremely important component of dealing with stresses and shit we dont even fuckin know enough about. Dont believe me go get high for years on anything and stop (for at LEAST a year btw) and tell me your body and mind doesnt function better. I dont knock anyones life choices as i have my own battles to fight but damn if someones gonna convince me substituting pot for any substance abuse is really the \"cure\" of addicts. - btw i fucking love marijuanna,and id love to continue smoking it daily, but you aint running at 100% when ya do", "2_Subreddit": "Futurology"}], "dfofhk5": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Just got some morphine ampoules, time for some pharma grade IV", "1_Text": "Last i checked when i shoot drugs i dont get paranoid about bits of glass and doing things like a fuckin doctor lol", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dfpqjr1": [{"0_Comment Submission": "As good as pharmaceutical morphine ampoules are, I'd rather have access to phrarma grade diamorphine (heroin)", "1_Text": "Thats legit", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dfpqkq4": [{"0_Comment Submission": "As good as pharmaceutical morphine ampoules are, I'd rather have access to phrarma grade diamorphine (heroin)", "1_Text": "Upvote for the stones", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dfpqur1": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Just because your an addict. ..", "1_Text": "Hahahaha", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgape24": [{"0_Comment Submission": "[I ate] King Soft-shell Crab Sandwich, Hurricane Alley, Boynton Beach, FL", "1_Text": "there 100% blue crabs i grew up on the chesapeake bay.. i didnt know people ate any other kind of soft shell I wouldnt eat one unless i was in baltimore", "2_Subreddit": "food"}], "dgapgyt": [{"0_Comment Submission": "As good as pharmaceutical morphine ampoules are, I'd rather have access to phrarma grade diamorphine (heroin)", "1_Text": "track marks and daddy issues baby", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgappqk": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What video game are you the most nostalgic about?", "1_Text": "Iv been stuck playing the old Rome Total War for like a year straight now.. not much more satisfying then a long and bloody Thrace campaign and eventually slaying the never ending roman armies one by one till your marching up the italian peninsula...", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dgapy1d": [{"0_Comment Submission": "A literal shit post but an important shit post.", "1_Text": "just stop eating food and live on haagan daz n heroin", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgaq0if": [{"0_Comment Submission": "A literal shit post but an important shit post.", "1_Text": "lmao you had a piece of your shit on a fork.. its tough out here", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgc5zn3": [{"0_Comment Submission": "A literal shit post but an important shit post.", "1_Text": "if im not mistaken its called a rusty astronaut... u shit in a condom tie it off.. freeze it and then commence to use it as a dildo", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dnsbnsu": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How real is The Wire?", "1_Text": "pratt and payson", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dowa8ze": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I've noticed that people use 'the fact I use opiates' as an immediate way to insult me", "1_Text": "lolzz", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dpr8emn": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I\u2019m not 100% clean from opiates, I do some oxy here and there.
