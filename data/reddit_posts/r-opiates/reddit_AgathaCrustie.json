I remember when you got sober, and I got sober shortly after you (today is day 130). I also remember when you found some dope in an old wallet and flushed it. Fucking incredible! \n\nI know that the want to score is there. You don\u2019t *need* to score anymore though. What keeps me going is that I\u2019m able to wake up everyday and get out of bed, that I don\u2019t wake up sick and wanting to give up on life. I can do whatever the fuck I want now! My life isn\u2019t run by that devil of a drug. \n\nI really, REALLY hope that you find the strength to keep going. I know you\u2019ve got it in you. I think that your day will come. 152 days is a long time, but in the long run, how long do 152 days compare to all of the time you spent using? You know that change doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Just keep at it. I really do feel like good things are ahead for you. \n\nI know that we don\u2019t know each other very well, but from what I\u2019ve seen on here, you seem like a good guy with a good head on his shoulders. Dat ass ain\u2019t bad either. \ud83d\ude09\n\nGood luck! Just think about all the times when you were using that you wanted to get sober.

I was diagnosed in high school and then fucked around with alcohol, weed, coke and adderall in college. Opiates came around right after I graduated college. I\u2019m 30 years old now. \n\nI used the opiates to help with the depression part of the bipolar, but using ultimately made things worse because I was masking all of the crazy emotions that come along with the disorder. Opiates made the extreme highs and lows even more extreme. \n\nI\u2019m sober and I\u2019m actually starting to feel the symptoms again, and it kinda feels good. I actually kinda dig some of the mania moments (although I DESPISE them when I\u2019m in bed at 4am trying to sleep). I\u2019m not taking any medication for it at the moment, as I want to experience me as I truly am.\n\nSo yeah, to answer your question...I have an accompanying mental disorder. \ud83e\udd2a", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwjzptt": [{"0_Comment Submission": "H.R.

Really awesome. It also sounds like you\u2019re a good person, and that it wasn\u2019t easy for the bakery to let you go. \n\nCake decorating is obviously something you love to do. Going off on a tangent, my father has been a cake decorator in NYC since the \u201870\u2019s, and he\u2019s the coolest guy I know. \n\nThis firing doesn\u2019t mean your life is over. It can be, though. A lot of people would use this as more of a reason to use, and would dig themselves into an even deeper hole. On the other hand, think about it - you lost your amazing job, and the drugs aren\u2019t even working anymore. At this point, using isn\u2019t going to necessarily make the pain of losing this job go away. It\u2019ll make you feel better for a bit, all the while making everything even worse. I think you know that. \n\nSometimes it takes something like this to happen for someone to wake up. I lost so much in my life due to drugs, and I hated my life. One day, after years and years of having H run my life, I quit that shit. All of the things that I loved and thought I would never be able to get back are coming back; in fact, amazing things that I didn\u2019t even think could happen are happening now because I\u2019m not living that life anymore. \n\nI\u2019m not telling you what you need to do; all I\u2019m saying is that if you really want it, you can get this work and your life back. After all, you\u2019ve got talent! Don\u2019t waste that shit! \n\nGood luck, broski!
