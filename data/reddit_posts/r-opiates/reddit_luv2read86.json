Understanding and handling this information are 2 very different things and I just don't ever want him to hate me or resent me if he were to find him when he's older and learn the truth and then come back at me angry because I didn't tell him and if I had of told him the truth he would of never looked for him. I just worry he will seek him out because he doesn't know and has hopes that he will find him looking to fill a void that he's felt his whole life. He may never tell me exactly how he feels and he knows he's loved so much but to grow up never knowing one of your parents has got to be hard and deep down I know he must wonder about him and if there's a chance to be in his life and has this overall outlook on some happy ending if he finds him.. but your right to know your DNA is half someone like him could fuck anyone up inside and I'm trying to figure out the right balance of honesty without sheltering him from the truth to avoid him being hurt but at the same time that's exactly what I want to do and i just don't know if my way of thinking is more about my feelings or his. As a mother you want to protect but once he's an adult it's no longer about what I think is best and I'm just so unsure how to handle something like this and by asking for help now I'm hoping to be more prepared if he does ask in a year or so or if he doesn't ask at all then do I tell him when he's 18 regardless?", "2_Subreddit": "Parenting"}], "dwr9m2w": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How to tell my son about his biological father \ud83d\ude14", "1_Text": "Also what you went through must of been hard and I worry that this situation may end up the same way.

All that would of came from him would of been lots of hurt and disappointment and I knew I could give you a better life full of love and make sure you were surrounded by good loving people while growing up and I can't say 100% that if you want to find him and you do that it will go the way you hope and that I fear all it will do is cause hurt.

Mine is bilking my health insurance....", "1_Text": "I do too. I'm so glad I go to the clinic I do but if I could change one thing it would be the the nurses on staff had authority to do a few more things that only our dr can do. So for example I'm tapering right now and I don't see my dr for 2 more weeks but I go down tomorrow another 2mg as planned but say that night I end up noticing a difference and feel a bit off and I think hmmm maybe I should go back up the 2mg and just take a break for a bit cuz I don't want to suffer. Well I can't just walk in the clinic and ask to see my dr. He's very busy and there are different drs on different days and we have 10 drs in my clinic so since it's something like putting me back 2mg or just getting the nurse to put stop tapering for now without dr consent would be very helpful instead of trying to get squeezed in to see the dr. But if it's more of an emergency, like my husband was rushed to Toronto hospital and I had to go there on my own cuz I had to go to the clinic just incase my husband was going to be there for days and I was on my last carry and I went to the clinic and asked if I could skip sampling on my normal day and if I could get 4 extra carries and they will email my dr so where ever he is he can say yes or no to my request and they are all pretty understanding with most people even if you don't have carries and something important comes up you can usually always work something out. The staff literally treat everyone like your their favorite and whatever the problem is that your having they will do whatever they can to help in anyways and then there's the group of people that just treat the staff like garbage and they just take it and I just give them so much credit, I'd lose my mind working there with some of the people that go there.", "2_Subreddit": "Methadone"}], "dwrzl7q": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How does your clinic operate? Mine is bilking my health insurance....", "1_Text": "Just to clarify I know the staff that aren't drs can't write a new script if I wanted to change my dose but since I'm tapering I just wish that if I get to a point where I need to take a break and the 2mg down effected me badly that I could simply go in talk to a nurse and have her get the dr to put me back up without me having to see him as he's in every Tues only and I pick up on Wed so kinda makes it hard to get in and I'd have to wait and go through the 2mg lower dose until I see him but I could also make a huge deal out of it and beg the nurses to email him to just do it now and get it fixed faster but there are over 1000 ppl at my clinic so it's always so busy so half the time they just say sorry your going to have to come in Tues and speak with him. So that's frustrating cuz from what I read in the states your counselors are always there and can do things like that when you need it and they just get it approved by the dr but you always have the option of going to your counselor and that they are there more then one day a week.", "2_Subreddit": "Methadone"}], "dwrznzm": [{"0_Comment Submission": "[Theme] Nova + zooper setup", "1_Text": "Haha yep.

My brother has a different dad then me and he walked out on him and my mother before he was 1 and he sought him out at 18 and found him in a different country and moved away immediately. He wasn't a horrible person but I was surprised that he just up and left to him after all my mom did to raise him and his dad never once tried to get ahold of him or see him and he forgave him instantly and I guess knowing that happened I am afraid if I dont tell my son the truth he will look for him but at the same time I agree that maybe I should leave that part out and just focus the most on him as a person and try my best to make it clear that it's a big mistake to look for him and it will only cause pain for him.", "2_Subreddit": "Parenting"}], "dwsf7go": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How to tell my son about his biological father \ud83d\ude14", "1_Text": "Yes.

She was just for youth so once I was 18 I couldn't see her officially but we became so close that we still met up anytime she could outside of work. She always went above and beyond for me and now I see her maybe once or twice a year but I was thinking of actually getting ahold of her and asking her to be the one that sits with us since she specializes in youth so that's great for my son and because she knows my whole history as well with everything that happened. Unfortunately there's a waiting list to get into her agency so I can't just ask her to take my son on after we talk to him but I know she will definitely make an effort to come talk to him afterwards if I feel he needs someone to talk to.
