The former clicks on stuff for you, kind of like the old macros on Windows, and the latter just has a LOT of random things that are very helpful.\n\nI got AutoShare to help automate web things (you can create an item to go into the Share menu, then run a Tasker task on the link), and AutoShortcut right after I bought Tasker on accident, but it comes in handy if you can look at the entire activity list for an app. For example, I use Autoshortcut and AutoInput to toggle on/off overlays, if a program refuses to install otherwise.\n\nTouchTask is supposed to have similar abilities to AutoInput, but the added \"Easy Setup\" in AI just sealed the deal for me.
