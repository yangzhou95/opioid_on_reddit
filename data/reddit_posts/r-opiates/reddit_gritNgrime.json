I've been burned more times than I care to admit. A few of those times I got my ass beat. Had a broken jaw, two pairs of glasses broken, and just general pain from some of these incidents. Though I didn't lose my money on some of these occasions, in retrospect I ended up paying more than if I'd just given it up (visit to the ER and new pairs of glasses). I kind of kept my pride intact knowing I didn't lose my money, but that knowledge didn't help much. Was burned a few weeks ago and even though I saw it happening before my eyes I just handed over the money because I know what some people will do and the last thing I needed was a broken nose, bruises, broken glasses, or even to be robbed of my other shit, like my phone (which has happened to me as well when I turned people down and they decided to up the ante). Dude could have pistol whipped you and broken some bones. As much as I would have liked to hear that you shot him because I love hearing stories where these fuckers get what they deserve, you made the right choice in my book.

Is there a chance it is cut with fent? Also, parking by a hospital won't guarantee you'll be saved if you fall out in your car (they may not see/find you or assume you're sleeping). You'd be better off doing the shot then going to hang out with your friends who could call 911 if you fall out. I assume they don't know you use, since if they did you might just do it at their place, but even if they don't they could still call 911 if you happen to fall out.
