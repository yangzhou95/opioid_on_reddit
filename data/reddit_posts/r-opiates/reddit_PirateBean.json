I have both and come from a dirt poor background. I walk a mile to and from work every day because I don't have a vehicle. And I still have severe depression and anxiety. If anything, rotten circumstances make it worse.\n\nTake my friend, for instance:\nHe suffers from more severe depression than I, and has been homeless for the past six months. Living in a shelter and working 8 hours a day, five days a week so that he could eventually afford a place to live. \nEvery day he got a little worse, a little more depressed, until one day he lost his job because of his mental illness.\n\nI think poverty and certain mental disorders/substance abuse problems go hand in hand.
