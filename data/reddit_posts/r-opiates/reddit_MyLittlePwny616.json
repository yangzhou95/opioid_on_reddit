He can be positive that he has straight dope, but I can almost guarantee you it's at least got fentalogue in it. The way I see it, if it gets you fuckin high without killing you, and it's got legs that hold you being well for 5+ hours, who the fuck cares if it's dope or fentalogue? It all does the same thing, so it's the definition of a moot point lol. This is so fucking stupid, as OP is too proud to test his shit or admit that maybe he can't identify opioids based on high alone so it doesn't matter. We all think what we think and he is stuck with his thoughts. It's a stalemate and we will never get an answer.
