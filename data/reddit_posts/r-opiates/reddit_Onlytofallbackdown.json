I went away for a weekend( 4 hours away to a Podunk town in PA) empty handed. I was broke and said okay I can do this. By that night I was sick. I couldn't sleep tossin and turning popping NyQuil every few hours. I woke up the next day feeling horrible. \n\nI was miles away from home and I couldn't do anything. At about 6 pm I was like maybe I can scrap together some empties in the bottom of my bag. So I'm looking through my backpack finding nothing but all ripped apart bags. Then I see it! i see what looks like a unopened stamp bag at the bottom of my backpack. I was like \"no way\". I reach for it and yup it's a full bag. I was shaking I was so happy. \n\nIt's nuts cause I really keep on top of how many bags I have ( we all do)and I never recall really missing a bag. It was perfect timing to find it. I was so sick and so far from anywhere even if I could go out and cop. Junkie Jesus indeed. \n\n\nI once also found a full bottle of 180mg methadone. Just lying there on the sidewalk by a bus stop. I felt really bad for the dude who lost it. I even looked him up on Facebook to return it. I couldn't find him though.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "d8c2jg9": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Missed u47 IV complications persist 6 mo. later - wtf is wrong with me??", "1_Text": "Have you've gotten any Mri's?
