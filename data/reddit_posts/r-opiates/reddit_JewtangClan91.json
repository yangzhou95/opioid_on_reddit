Thank you so much! I feel so awful making him feel like he can only play when I\u2019m sleeping or busy doing something. \n\nHe always asks if I can just sit on the couch at least and I\u2019ll play on my phone or watch something on our projector but that can leave me with headaches having so much going on at once. \n\nI\u2019m going to show this to him and see if we can start playing some. I do have ONE issue whenever I ask about these games, he never explains it well for me and it leaves me frustrated and confused.

I deeply appreciate everyone taking the time to give me some great ideas. \n\nSo the YouTuber thing sounds like a great idea if I found someone playing and explaining a game my husband would enjoy playing I could at least get an idea of it before I dive in. \n\nWhen people start talking in either a monotone voice or are just business and not funny in any way I lose interest extremely fast. So any funny people on YouTube who play games and explain it well that y\u2019all can recommend would be awesome. \n\nI reeeeeeeally appreciate this guys and I can\u2019t wait to show my husband! Even if I can\u2019t play his usual games I think the fact that I\u2019m willing to try or we could possibly find a different game to play together I think that would make him extremely happy. \n\nThank you all again!", "2_Subreddit": "gaming"}], "dwqhnkh": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Range handcheck", "1_Text": "Yes", "2_Subreddit": "Vaping"}], "dwqi4hw": [{"0_Comment Submission": "The small ugly creature, who are you?", "1_Text": "Wait what\u2019s the documentary", "2_Subreddit": "sleepparalysislogs"}], "dwqi8rr": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Icing some desserts", "1_Text": "Fuck I\u2019m so hungry", "2_Subreddit": "oddlysatisfying"}], "dwqlpi6": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Marine Lance Cpl.

I got my mom an iguana for Mother\u2019s Day a few years back and we went to pick it up and on the floor was this large cage. I peaked in and I was like \u201cwhat are these?\u201d The guy working there said theyre guinea pigs, an older woman dropped them off early and couldn\u2019t care for them so they have to get sold soon or they\u2019ll have to be snake food. \n\nI was like \u201cwhat\u2019s a guinea pig??\u201d He lifted their home and I was like \u201cILL TAKE THEM\u201d my mom was violently shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting a giant hamster\u201d the guy stepped in to say that they were already at least 2 years old so it shouldn\u2019t be a long time we have them. So my mom agreed. \n\nI fell madly in love with Guinea pigs. The female unfortunately died about 6-8 months after we had them during childbirth. She was extremely sweet and I cried so hard. I also researched the hell out of guinea pigs and was so worried for my male, but he lived about 3 1/2 more years loving life as a bachelor and had myself and my mom wrapped around his tiny fingers. \n\n\nAnyways, enjoy your new babies! My husband says when we move into our new home I can get a pair and I\u2019m so excited.
