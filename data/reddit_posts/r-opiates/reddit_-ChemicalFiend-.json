Based on your description of her I'd imagine she's definitely at the right dose. If she was suffering, she would make it known very easily. If her condition is definitely terminal, continuing those medication is definitely the right way to transition her to the end. \n\nThe only better option is euthanasia in most cases of your description. It's sad that that is not an option for the majority of terminal patients in most 1st world countries. That is definitely a debate I think needs to be had. \n\nSorry for inserting my (political?) opinion here. I just think it's an important topic that is relevant to your post. \n\nI do wish you and your family well. If you want to know what's going on in her head now, she probably feels no pain, and feels pretty good on those meds. Probably does have a care in the world, and the thought of dying doesn't bother her in the least right now.", "2_Subreddit": "askdrugs"}], "duurf76": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Ritalin vs other Amphetamines", "1_Text": "Thanks.
