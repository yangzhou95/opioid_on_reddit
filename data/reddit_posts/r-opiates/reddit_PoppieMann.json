He's made it so hard for people with legitimate pain to get help from a Pain Management Doctor in New Jersey to help keep their pain in check. One can only hope that He or one of his loved ones need pain meds one day because they are in so much pain  and I hope they have to go to the streets to buy dope because they can't find a doctor who will take them as a patient ! One of my loved ones has had THREE failed spinal fusions and was dropped by her PM Doctor because the Dr. is afraid to continue being a PM Dr. In N.J.
