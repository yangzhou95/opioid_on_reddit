However the bioavailability is still between 30% and 60%. It is most certainly not negligible. And of course with intranasal administration there is the benefit of a quicker onset and more powerful come-up. Personally I don't like to waste about half of my Xanax by snorting it, but I will every so often take a bar and then proceed to snort a half bar afterwards to potentiate the euphoria associated with the come up. Is this truly such a waste that we must berate others about it on Reddit? I don't think so. There is a noticeable difference in the euphoria experienced on the come up and then what does not get absorbed intranasally proceeds to drop down into the stomach where it is absorbed at the full oral bioavailability: ~90%. If people want to snort their Xanax, more power to them in my opinion. Personally I'd suggest not to snort your entire dose because certainly some is lost, but to say that snorting Xanax in any situation is such a waste that it should not be considered a viable means of administering the drug is ridiculous.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "den7s0o": [{"0_Comment Submission": "People", "1_Text": "Oh and to set the record straight - Water solubility is not the end all be all determinate of intranasal bioavailability.

When I posted this I was only hoping that some of you would find it as amusing as I did that I would even think of this so randomly while in the bathroom. My point was simply this:\n1. As a kid/young teen I once made a runescape account as a girl.\n2. I was regularly interacted with while playing as that female character, which was strange because playing my normal account I had gone for weeks if not months before without ever speaking to anyone on the site.\n3. I ended up using these interactions to my advantage essentially preying on sad kids, like myself a few years previous, who wanted to feel loved through the safety of a computer screen.\n4. As an adult when I first had a serious conversation with someone about feminism and what it means, the first thing I thought about was that experience from when I was a kid. And I thought it was funny.\n\nI thought it was funny for the same reasons you all have berated me in the comments. The issues in that case are quite trivial in comparison to the real issues women face. I agree with you. That was my point. I played runescape as a girl and got free stuff and that was the first time I ever experienced sexism and understood it to some degree. It was minor sexism. Nothing to be enraged at. Nothing to fight against. And certainly not something that should be the sole reason one takes up arms in support of feminism. But it was just what I thought of. And I thought that was the point of r/Showerthoughts. I simply wanted to share a funny story, I didn't mean to come across like I was either an extremely na\u00efve and offensive supporter of feminism or making fun of it. I love women. I love people in general and I think everyone is deserving of equal rights and equal treatment. I would have never posted this had I known that I would come across as anything but that.
