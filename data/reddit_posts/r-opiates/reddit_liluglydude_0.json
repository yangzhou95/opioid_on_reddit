Maybe it\u2019s an inextricable part of being human, maybe it\u2019s maladaptive. Maybe, it\u2019s adaptive, or maybe it\u2019s a misappropriated response to adaptivity. Nonetheless it is an umbrella for a host of other problems. I have digestive issues as well, specifically GERD. It\u2019s kind of like heartburn, but differs in symptoms from acid reflux. This condition in itself runs a close second to the improvement of my life if it were absent. However it\u2019s hard to distinguish between the two since i\u2019m sure that the issues can work in tandem. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to have an appetite when you have anxiety, and when you do eat, you may find you are a \u201cnervous eater,\u201d as people have pointed out in me before. When you\u2019re anxious, your food doesn\u2019t digest fully. You don\u2019t get the same satisfaction and benefits from a good meal, instead, you\u2019re just still at \u201cdis-ease.\u201d There\u2019s been times where I have been less anxious than others, and surely anxiety has a way of coloring a persons personality with idiosyncrasies that can really shape up a unique person. \n\nBut that\u2019s just optimistic, the rest of the time is spent internalizing most things people say, and that stems from a low self esteem. Even if one has a great worth they are aware of inside, one that lays deep rooted \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d of all the cinematics of anxiety, it still doesn\u2019t quell the ways in which anxiety runs rampant in ones life. It can reduce the good in ones life as a happenstance, and turn the bad in ones life as a doom that was long impending. \n\nNot to sound masochistic, but after enough reinforcement and conditioning, it\u2019s hard to distinguish where one bad seed came to fruition and from which fruit the seed was laid. Maybe i\u2019d be more calm, cool, collective, without anxiety. Maybe i\u2019d be more poised, unreactive, and composed, but I wouldnt really be the \u201cme,\u201d that in fact many people have come to love. But the longer I stew on the matter, I have to wonder if the idea of \u201cme\u201d is really even an \u201cidea\u201d I want to entertain anymore... and maybe that\u2019s really the source of it all in the first place. \n\nI\u2019ve more or less reduced it all to the spirit of the times, and that I should be anxious, because the world is an uncertain place, or atleast my world (sense of security) has always been largely uncertain. Anxiety as a mood disorder is one thing, Anxiety as a complex is another intricate web that is spun by the ebb and flow of environment and internalization. \n\nMaybe, Anxiety in an existential context might keep you vigilant. Maybe it just ruins your quality of life. Be careful what you wish for, what would be left of me without it?
