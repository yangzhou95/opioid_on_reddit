Spelling doesn't matter. \n\nAnd yeah if you over pronounce the T in \"daft\" it's going to make the vowel sound shorter. Most people aren't doing that though. Go on YouTube and look up any video of a rap song's rhyme scheme. [Here](https://youtu.be/OFBZbFGHSa8) is an example. Notice how most of the words rhyme based off their central vowel sound, not the final consonant or anything else. The rhyme in the OP is in the same vain as that.
