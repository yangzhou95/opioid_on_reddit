Because she is comparing teenagers who are bought a car by their parents vs grown adults who expect a more reasonable salary for the JOB they do.\n\nAnd getting a teenager a car isn't even such a crazy concept anyway. They need to learn to drive, and many parents work and cannot drive their kid to school. I'm all for getting your kid a nice car if you can. (And I definitely think this country can find a way to pay teachers better) It doesn't need to be a Lexus, but getting them a newer/used car with good safety features, one that isn't at risk of breaking down is a good thing. \n\nWhat is her problem?", "2_Subreddit": "news"}], "dwu0s9o": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Gov.
