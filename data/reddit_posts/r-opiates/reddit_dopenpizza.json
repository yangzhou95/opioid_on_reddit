Too many lives have been taken.\n\nYou need to be serious about getting clean and staying clean. Doing so will require you to get rid of anything and anyone that may coax you into getting high. If there are people that you will need to distance yourself from tell them whats up; if they know. True friends will always be there, and will understand the circumstances so don\u2019t worry about losing/breaking friendships. Always keep busy or atleast try to (i personally relapse a lot purely out of boredom, i live in a small shithole with absolutely nothing to do so i turn to dope). Working out/physical activity will help a ton; keep occupied, sleep better/easier, release dopamine, etc. SUPPORT, be open with those who know. If you feel an urge to use text someone and talk with them. There support will help reassure you.
