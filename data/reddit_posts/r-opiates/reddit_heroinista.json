Unfortunately, not all state's laws are created equally... A lot of the states that claim to have a Good Samaritan Law in place still give police the authority to make arrests for offenses such as possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and more.\n\nI recommend checking this page out to see what the law looks like in your home state!\n\nhttps://www.samhsa.gov/capt/sites/default/files/resources/good-samaritan-law-tool.pdf", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwk9hfy": [{"0_Comment Submission": "The worst feeling", "1_Text": "Just don't give up.

They will ruin your life eventually.\n\nNow, since you're probably going to do them anyways, I'd recommend you take all 3 at once on an empty stomach. Anticipate that there is a real possibility that you might throw up.

If you're trying to get high than you may as well catch the best high you possibly can right? 15mg isn't a very large dose so if it's taken with food you're going to lose a lot of the high. If you take it on the empty stomach, the worst that will happen is you might get nauseous, MAYBE you'll throw up a bit but you'll feel so good you won't care. The way I see it, the *worst case scenario *is if you take the pills with food and don't end up getting high at all because then you will have missed out on a great time and you'll need a do over.
