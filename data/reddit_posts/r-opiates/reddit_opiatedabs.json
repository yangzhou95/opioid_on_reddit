I disagree with that. I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from. You\u2019re not looking at the entire picture here tho. Every overdose is different. Not every drug addict shoots up. My cousin died from an OD in 2014. He had just gotten a really fucking awesome job and decided he wanted to have a last hurrah with the boys before he started his new job. He wasn\u2019t a drug addict but he did drugs occasionally. He was on Xanax and there was heroin they smoked and he overdosed. He ended up dying 3 times in the hospital. His body kept shutting down. He was a good dude and great dad. I died in 2016. I was clean off opiates. I had taken a Xanax and I guess some dude gave me another bar and I blacked out. I\u2019ve never been an IV user of heroin and I was clean and this same dude gave me a shot of heroin. I immediately overdosed and I died twice in the hospital. I had no idea I was given a shot of heroin either until later. I thought I wrecked my car when I woke up for some reason. \n\nNot every drug user that overdoses wants to die or even knows they\u2019re gonna die. I get what you\u2019re saying by we should take accountability but not every situation is the same. Yeah I took Xanax but I won\u2019t take accountability for that shot of heroin and dying. I didn\u2019t think one of the guys i was hanging out with was gonna feed me Xanax and give a clean person their very first of heroin. Idk yeah I knowingly took the first Xanax and know the dangers of it but I just disagree with what you\u2019re saying.", "2_Subreddit": "Stims"}], "dwsl4yp": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Intense disorientation upon standing", "1_Text": "Be careful.
