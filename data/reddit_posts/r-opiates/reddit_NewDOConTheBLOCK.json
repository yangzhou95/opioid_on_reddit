My mother is a neurotic paranoid borderline schizophrenic and alcoholic, and would accuse me of the dumbest bullshit ever when I lived at home.  Any time I would say anything to her or call her out on her own hypocritical bullshit... her excuse was always \"blah blah blah my house blah blah blah\" so I said fuck it and packed some shit and left.  Crashed on couches/spare beds of various friends until I could find a place to live \"permanently\".  \n\nI wish you the best of luck with your situation and hope your mom gets the help she needs.\n\nEdit: what the fuck is up with Reddit  (Or just this sub?) not showing paragraphs and sticking everything together..?", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dt9dtlv": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Day 2 heavy dope habit cold turkey.

If you don't die in the process of getting your tolerance to the inhuman level that my tolerance is, you will essentially become immune to opiates and will no longer get high.  Not only will you no longer get high, whenever you don't have opiates all over your receptors, you will be miserable.  And even when your receptors are saturated with opiates, you'll find you only feel somewhat normal, and no longer experience genuine happiness.  All this is providing you are independently wealthy and have a ton of money, or have a script comparable to mine.  You won't love opiates anymore, you will hate them.  You'll hate what they've done to you and hate that your life is an opiate induced prison... where you need a ridiculous amount of opiates just to function.  You will fully understand anhedonia in the way that only someone who is experiencing or has experienced depression has.  You can read about it, you can think you understand it, but you can't truly appreciate it until you experience it.

And while poetic, I can promise you that you wouldn't deal with a life of withdrawal as opposed to a day without her.  Either you haven't experienced withdrawal, or don't realise how bad withdrawal can actually get.  There's no such thing as a \"perc 30\", so I assume you're talking about a 30mg oxy IR.  If that's all the both of you need to stay out of withdrawal.. You definitely don't know how bad withdrawal can get.  Also, while you may be willing to choose her over opiates... you're making a huge mistake assuming she would choose you over opiates.  That just shows you don't truly understand the power of addiction.  Addictions have ruined 30+ year marriages, torn families apart, caused the closest of friends to steal from and betray each other, etc...  to think that your relationship that's still in its honeymoon phase is above the reach of addiction is as naive as it gets.\nYou're gonna do what you're gonna do.. but ultimately there will be a winner in the fight that you just realized is going on - addiction vs. your relationship.  I truly hope you're right (for your sake) about her choosing you over the drugs... but the longer this love affair with opiates goes on... the closer addiction is to winning.  I've seen this play out 10-12 times...and all I'll say is that the odds are not in your favor. That's the cold ugly truth.  If you two are going to overcome the odds, you need to sit down with her and have a serious conversation.  If she's not ready she needs to get ready, because by the time she says she's ready on her own... it will be too late.  Good luck, I really hope you make it through together.
