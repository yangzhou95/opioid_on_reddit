This morning I decided I was good to go... inducted 1mg Sub, took a hot bath and laid down in bed and dozed off for 30 minutes or so. Woke up with minor chills, but my headache was under control, back pain still killing me. Inducted another .5mg Sub and I\u2019m pretty much 100% now... feeling just fine.

And everyone is different..  but you must be patient with the drug.

Marijuana is a great herb for me) keeps w/d FAR away and cravings at ease. Such a low dose, yet I feel so normal.
