However, some women are also arrested for child neglect, and may serve time in addition to losing custody. In states with the harshest laws, women who experience drug-related miscarriages could even be charged with homicide.\n\nBecause we already know that prosecution doesn't stop drug use, these legal measures can only be understood to put the child's interests and society's interests ahead of the mother's.

And they\u2019d say ow yeah no problem lmk what you an them think of my product? And the dude that never gave anything extra or for free always had the weakest shit except the one time he re-upped and had me one crazy!

I d tell him his shit wasn\u2019t good but when he had this one batch I told him keep copping from same plug, or have his plug cut it the same amount or as close as possible?!?!?! \n\nGuess what it never happened!!! And especially sucks cause he is 3 blocks from my house so it would be so convenient all the time but his product 99 outta 100 it\u2019s garbage, it\u2019s my last resort for if I cannot take a 15-20 minute ride down the way and 15-20 minutes ride back home", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwobmgz": [{"0_Comment Submission": "New connect has no idea how much to put in a bag!", "1_Text": "Looks like quality stuff though?
