Study and understand harmonic progression and harmonic rhythm. My process looks something like this:\n\nSit down with a piano or some other simple instrument that has a wide range of frequencies. Piano is great because you have access to everything from extreme lows to extreme highs all at once.\n\nFigure out a chord progression that sounds good. You really need to study common harmonic progressions at the very least for this. Understanding why certain chords sound good next to each other, why some want to resolve to the tonic, etc is very important. It's important to note that you aren't messing with ARRANGEMENT at this point - you're just keeping it simple and figuring out your progression.\n\nIf you have a verse/chorus/bridge structure then figure out if you want to keep the same progression all the way through (nothing wrong with this, but you'll have to be more creative to keep the song from getting boring) or if you want to write additional progressions.\n\nOnce you have all of your progressions and know what order you want to play them in (again, study existing songs) lay them down in a DAW and start working on the drums. Use the drums to add and subtract energy from different parts of the song.\n\nOnce your drums are laid down, create a vocal scratch track. I could write a book about creating good vocals. I can tell you that if you want to write popular music, you need to have the drums in place before you start messing with vocals. Making a song catchy has a LOT to do with how the rhythm of the vocals bounces off the rhythm of the drums. I've found it impossible to create this interplay unless you have the drums down first. Changing the drums once you've created the vocals can really disrupt that interplay as well. Another thing to note about vocals is that catchy vocals often do not make huge pitch changes between syllables. There is often a lot of note repetition, which brings the rhythm of the vocal more into focus. Notice how rap songs can be catchy even with almost no melodic shift in the vocals. That's because the rhythm is incredibly important here. Learn about motifs, and use them throughout your vocals and elsewhere in the song.\n\nNow you have drums, a piano playing the basic harmony and at least a good idea of what the vocals are going to do. Time to tear that piano track apart and start creating an actual arrangement of it with other instruments (unless you just love the simple piano part on its own). You need to learn to IMPLY the underlying chords that you used in the piano track, but you may not be directly playing them at all. You may have the bass playing the root of each chord rhythmically, then a synth moving between the third and fifth, which would imply a triad chord for that part, even though you aren't playing all of the notes at once.\n\nNow you're getting somewhere. Keep revising that arrangement and use it to move the dynamics of the song. At this point, your process could go anywhere. Think outside the box. Also, do NOT mess with mixing or advanced effects stuff at this point or you'll again get derailed. You'll want to, but writing a song to completion takes discipline.\n\nOnce you have an arrangement you're happy with, you need to go back and add unique details to each section to break up any monotony. You can do this with little additions to the rhythm in one part or by triggering unique samples here and there that each appears only once in the song.\n\nRefine, refine, refine. Once you listen to your song a million times, you will start to tune out the little bits that could be better, but a fresh set of ears will hear them immediately. If any section starts to sound boring, a transition doesn't flow or that something is just off, you need to figure out how to fix it. Sometimes you will have to delete a lot of hard work to go back and rethink it. If you want the track to be GOOD, this is what it takes.\n\nFinally, get into the mixing, mastering, etc.", "2_Subreddit": "synthesizers"}], "dwuy0xl": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Say you were a rapper or someshit that had stacks of cash, what \u201cimmoral\u201d or \u201cfrowned upon\u201d thing would you do?", "1_Text": "Pretty sure as soon as you accept cash for sex, that makes you a hooker by definition.
