The price was a huge contributing factor but not the biggest one for me actually. Perhaps even bigger than the high price of Oxy, ($30/pill), I feel Suboxone really did a number on my tolerance as well and made me switch to china a lot quicker than I would have if at all. \n          \n\nAfter being addicted to oxy for the first 5 months I got prescribed Suboxone for 9, but once my relationship went south and had other troubles, I decided to quit and relapse, and low and behold, my withdrawals were WORSE, like A LOT WORSE than they were with Oxy.  Unbeknownst to me at the time I went into the dr for them, I had no idea that the opioid within Buprenorphine/Suboxone was considered a stronger opiate than oxycodone (despite no feelings of euphoria while on it). I went back to Oxy for awhile, but that just wasn't cutting it anymore after I had affected my opiate tolerance level with Suboxone plus coupled with that the extremely high price/scarcity, and before long that had me looking for something stronger than Oxy, and there's not really a whole lot out there readily available on the street besides heroin. So yea, perhaps choosing to do oxy for 5 months put me down this path, but I highly doubt I would have tried H as soon as 14-15 months after I started opiates/opioids if it wasn't for the help of Suboxone severely upping my opiate level tolerance.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwt5wbj": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Would you have switched to heroin if oxys were still everywhere?", "1_Text": "I used to hate how H seems a lot more chill than the Oxy head rush when I first switched, but yea, now I enjoy that mellow vibe a lot more than the energetic euphoria Oxy gave.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwtb8jl": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Would you have switched to heroin if oxys were still everywhere?", "1_Text": "Yea..

I had gotten addicted enough to withdrawal after the first month or so, and by month 5 I was having to buy at least 2-3 to feel better and 4-10 if I wanted to be actually faded and feel like I was on drugs. Added to that, I also support my fiance's habit whom currently doesn't work so multiply whatever that daily total is by 2. Then multiply that out by 30 or however many days in a given month and multiply it by $30 to factor in the ridiculous prices for Oxy 30 mgs, and you can see that it financially gets out of hand really quick. (2\\*2\\*30\\*$30 - 10\\*2\\*30\\*$30) = (4\\*30\\*$30 - 20\\*30\\*$30) = (120\\*$30 - 600\\*$30) = ($3600 = $18000).
