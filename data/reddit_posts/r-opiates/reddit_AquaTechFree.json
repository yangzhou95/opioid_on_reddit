Sleep cycles seem to come from the fact that in the wild you may need to wake up from a danger, so your body does not put you in REM sleep right from the start and instead goes through stages of lesser to then deeper stages of sleep. So if you wake up groggy in say stage 3 sleep and are only awake for a couple minutes then your body has no time to get rid of the chemicals and realize you are well rested. (If there is an actual danger though then Adrenalin will pump itself to the for front and cancel out your sleepy chemicals). Instead you wake up and in those couple of minutes still feel like you are tired due to the chemicals your body has produced, so you go back to sleep. It's not just the brain saying \"hey I'm tired lets sleep\" but also the chemicals your brain has already triggered to help you sleep. Kind of like trying to open a pickle jar right when you wake up. Sure your awake and it would make sense for you muscles to work right away, but if you are coming from a REM sleep then the chemicals are still there and your muscles won't work right for a few minutes meaning you probably cannot open that jar. \n\nSource: Who knows, I'm drunk and have no medical background.", "2_Subreddit": "explainlikeimfive"}], "dut8xn7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "ELI5: How does sleep debt/build up work?", "1_Text": "I've drank way to much in my adult life so I've gotten better at handling myself.
