I've always been around hardworking people, my Bf not so much.. So when it comes to wanting to quit things he always says it's so hard and I tell him it's a matter of willpower.

When you use drugs like H and other drugs you start to overfill these pockets and start to stretch  them out and can make them huge compared to how they we're originally.\nWhen you withdraw you're \"happy pockets\" have nothing and can't be filled with the seratonin you have naturally. It can take years to physically have those  pockets shrink which is why alot of drug users can feel majorly depressed even after they are clean. (On top of the depression that may have lead to drug use)\n\nIn summary, you can feel suicidal and depressed because you lack enough seratonin.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwqlh6s": [{"0_Comment Submission": "2 Dboys owe me extra but I don't want it right now-fuck me!", "1_Text": "Not much, both were only a few points", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwrltt5": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Making moves with the plug", "1_Text": "God damn that's some sweet looking fire!
