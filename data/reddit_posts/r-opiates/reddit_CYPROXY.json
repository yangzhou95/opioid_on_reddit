I was on 100mg a day myself for a methadone addiction and was hooked on lope for over 5 years. One thing I can suggest is that you start dosing your lope WAY further apart. I basically got so broke I couldn't afford to even buy lope every day so I started dosing every other day and didn't notice any difference. I was also dabbling with the occasional opiate at the time as well so that helped too.\n\nThen I started dosing every 3 or 4 days. I never really even paid attention to it really. I was so busy with other more important stuff I just noticed one day that I hadn't dosed in 4 days  and was starting to feel some back pain.  I dosed (at this point in my lope addiction I was only taking 20 pills a day) and then didn't dose again for 4 days or more. I really don't remember but I do remember that before I knew it I hadn't had any in over a week and decided to just not get anymore.\n\nLike 3 weeks later the FDA put out their new regulation suggestions limiting the amount you can get at once. It was fucking kismet.\n\nAdditionally, I'll add that lope isn't inherently cardiotoxic. It *can* cause Torsades and long QT syndrome but if I recall correctly, lope seriously depletes potassium which affects heart chemistry and in turn calcium and sodium channels or some such thing (im too tired to cite any references). Some people have taken massive doses for long periods with no issues and others haven't been so lucky.\n\nPersonally I didn't have any issues until I smoked a cigarette and my heart started freaking out. This was before the \"lope is cardiotoxic\" buzz phrase caught on so I didn't figure it was the lope at the time. I dropped my dose significantly after doing some homework and the problems went away.\n\nIn any case, if you're dropping lope and staying clean you're going to feel the depression, lack of motivation, et al for months. If you dabble with the occasional opiate off and on without substituting for the lope then you might be able to manage the worst of the WD's from the lope. \n\nI found that *any* amount of oxy would make my lope WD's disappear and when I was on oxy benders, I didn't take any lope at all - for weeks.\n\nI dunno if any of this helps you or muddy's the waters for you .", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dvlwh6q": [{"0_Comment Submission": "1g of tar put into a vial.
