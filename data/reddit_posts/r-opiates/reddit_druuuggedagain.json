Even long term.\n\nI have been using kratom on and off for 3 years with little to no negative impact on physical or mental health. It continues to surprise me with how effective it is without all the negative effects that traditional medications carry.\n\nLimiting usage depends more on your personality and willpower, the reason I say this, is I do not experience any WD when I stop taking kratom. For me it's purely a mental issue.\n\nThe tolerance you build will quickly disappoint if you try to \"chase the dragon\". Keeping your doses consistant and not upping it when tolerance comes into the picture is the difference between a healthy relationship with kratom and an addictive one.\n\nJust like anything that feels so nice it is easy to make exceptions and break your own rules. I dose twice a day at 6g and that seems to work for me. Again, I don't experience any WD on days off but that's just me and EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. Experiment and see how you react on days off, you don't want to take kratom for months then be surprised that you do get WD symptoms when you run out or take a day off. \n\nExperiment, everyone is different.\n\nTake into consideration I am an ex-heroin addict (36 days clean!) so my view on what is and isn't considered WD symptoms may be different than someone that has never been through really bad WD. Like I said though, constipation was my only issue with kratom and at its worst, it was just extremely uncomfortable and thankfully didn't require any doctor visits. \n\nEdit: I also take phenibut 2x a week for the same reason. If you can handle not getting addicted to that stuff then kratom should be a walk in the park. I see you are 17 and it looks like you care about harm reduction. \ud83d\udc4d I like to see younger people doing research and asking questions.
