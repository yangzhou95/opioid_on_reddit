I ruined my last romantic relationship over things said on the last couple days of a week long meth bender, (she didn't even know I was still using at the time), and since then, I've been very careful to control myself and not do too much, none past 2pm, never more then 3 days in a row, and most importantly, at least 4 hours of sleep when I'm using multiple days in a row. I'm totally powerless over IV coke (speedballing) tho...  Overdosed 4 times, two in the same week, and shit man, I go fucking bonanza chasing that bellringer. I actually gave myself tinnitus from excessive IV coke use believe it or not. While I still do h daily and meth a few times a week, coke is a drug I steer clear of...
