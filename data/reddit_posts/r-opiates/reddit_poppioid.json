Plus another question", "1_Text": "I can't speak to whether agmatine is bad for your heart. I do know that it is a common supplement used in strength training and cardio, and is healthy for you in normal doses. I'm actually pretty sure your body makes it on it's own, too. There was a study I read about where it was used in 1500mg-2500mg daily totals to stall/lower tolerance but I can't remember where I saw it. I recommend looking into it before using high doses. Proglumide, if you can get a prescription for it, is very effective in actually *reversing* tolerance to opioids. But kratom is not an opioid, so I'm not certain if it will have the same effect on tolerance or not.\n\nAs for the blue light poster, I'm not going to get into an argument over whether or not you're experiencing placebo effect. For me the effect comes on in 20-30 minutes on an empty stomach and lasts 4-5 hours. I'm certain this is not placebo. I've experienced what you are at higher doses as well. \n\nI do agree with him that its possible your tolerance may be higher again because of repeated high doses. I also think, again, that you may have some kratom with lower alkaloid %. I suggest doing some research and figuring out which vendors have the best strains right now and try ordering them. \n\nThere isn't a ton of science available for kratom as there is for regulated medications, and there is plenty of anectdotal reports that kratom is, well, fickle in the sense of it changing it's effects from strains to dosages to people to location and beyond.\n\nI do think you'll eventually figure it out, though. I suggest trying new strains and amounts. And remember that just because a strain or dosage \"works for everyone\" does not mean it will work for you. Gold strains for example, are ones that most people love but they do absolutely nothing for me no matter how I do it. Another good idea would be to make a tea with it. It will be easier than consuming powdered leaf, it will make it easier to absorb and you can make it as strong or weak as you want. This may work better for you.\n\nThank you for changing how you describe kratom.

Decriminalizing drugs and instead making it a health issue has had wonderful results in other locales that have done it. They've seen huge drops in ODs (I believe it was Portugal that saw a breathtaking 80% in overdose fatalities). They are focusing on educating users, giving them access rehabilitation, to clean and proper paraphernalia (for lack of a better word) and safe spaces to occupy while using/under the influence of the substances. Additionally there is less fear of being caught and punished, which is what most often leads to unsafe behavior and dangerous situations.\n\nMost of the harm in using these substances is ignorance. Punishment and stigma of using often hinders rehabilitation and leads to relapse. \n\nThis is the way to win the \"war on drugs.\" \n\nEDIT: Although the FDA/DEA have another reason behind the lies about kratom.

White Borneo is one of the most potent strains there is, I just got some yellow Borneo and it is insane. It's almost too much.\n\nYou can get agmatine at GNC and vitamin shoppe too.
