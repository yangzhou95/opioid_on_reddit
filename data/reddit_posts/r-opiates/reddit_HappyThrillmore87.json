I\u2019m just winding a up a brief 2 week run of various opiates and plan to use Kratom to kick.  I want to use as a little as possible.  My habit is not very big.  Should I keep my Kratom doses to 2-3 times per day?  I don\u2019t have a scale.  Should I use a teaspoon (ish) per does?  Lastly, how long do you think I will need it for?  Will 4-5 days be sufficient?
