Cuz, while this is quite a unique scenario considering we're actually talking about the fourth and fifth installments in a series overall, it does feel like a classic example of a movie greatly over performing compared to its relative expectations being followed by a sequel that is indeed successful but by many is deemed a failure due to unreasonably high adjusted initial expectations and not being able to top its predecessor or come close to even matching it.  \n\nMaybe it is a bold prediction against the general consensus, but I wouldn't be crazy surprised with a 38+% drop in WW numbers between the two.
