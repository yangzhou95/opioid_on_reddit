I think you did a pretty good job. I like your use of metaphors, though sometimes I got a little confused on what you were actually trying to say. Like when you said \u201chorseback blood coat\u201d I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re describing. I actually took it literally at first and got an image of a mangled and bloody horse, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite what you meant haha. Perhaps it just went over my head though. \n\nI really like your use of alliteration though. I\u2019m not sure if it was intentional but you did a really good job. I liked the \u201cthundering, through\u201d \u201chear, howl\u201d \u201ccamouflage, creature\u201d \u201chilltop, hounds\u201d \u201cvibrant, vermillion\u201d etc. I always think that\u2019s pretty clever and fun to read.

I\u2019m surprised someone responded at this point. But I\u2019m super glad you did. All your suggestions, I\u2019ll think hard on. Thank you. I\u2019m also a chick describing a dude. Sorry for the confusion, but you\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t really go into descriptive detail on the person itself. I guess I was more describing how I felt. This is a thing I\u2019m dealing with in real life and this dude has a girlfriend and is a lot older than me so if he decided to cheat on her or go after me, I feel like I\u2019d lose some respect for him and myself, so that\u2019s why he\u2019s unobtainable. But as you know, I\u2019m crushin\u2019 the fuck out of him. \n\nYou\u2019re right, I actually added a lot of adverbs and the excess because I was trying to make the lines longer. I did have a little better meter in the first draft of this, but for some reason when I write, sometimes my poems lines get longer as I go on. And I had wanted it to all match in relative length but I can see that you saw right through the bullshit lol. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right, some of the cliches were most likely laziness on my part.
