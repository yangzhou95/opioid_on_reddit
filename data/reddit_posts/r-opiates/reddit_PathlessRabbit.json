I have been depressed for a few years (I\u2019m 16) and it\u2019s gotten better and gotten worse I guess I\u2019m bipolar lol. Recently I\u2019ve been noticing a lotttt more anxiety (I started taking adderall 2 months ago) but I can deal with it. Sometimes at school I\u2019ll need to get like 10 different things done throughout the day and I\u2019ll be doing things for other classes in another class and all day I have so many things to get done I\u2019ll get so focused on one thing that I\u2019ll completely forget the other things I need to finish and there\u2019s so much going on in my head that instead of getting sidetracked while working, I get sidetracked into more other work and I think that cycle causes the anxiety. Also it makes my body feel very strange sometimes like I\u2019ll pinch my arm or leg and I can feel my hand pinching it but I can\u2019t feel the pain in my arm/leg as if i was touching someone else because I don\u2019t feel the pain. Also my dick shrinks when flaccid when I\u2019m on it, but not when erect which is what matters I guess.
