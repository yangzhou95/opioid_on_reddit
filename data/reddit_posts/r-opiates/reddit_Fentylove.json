And that treatment was ibogaine,I never even looked into cause I have never heard of I until rn when I read this post! That's crazy, I think it might be a sign because I haven't wanted to stop useing until this week I finally decided that I dont want to be a slave to this terribly wonderful drug anymore.

As for other questions needle size is probably preference based but I've heard some people claim they can use a smaller gauge then with H because of clogging but they must have not been filtering their H very well. I thought missing H hurt but it is nothing compared to crystal and I feel the misses don't go away a LOT longer also unlike H applying heat didn't seem to help reducing the size so I feel IMing would go horribly n not sure if it would even get you high .", "2_Subreddit": "Stims"}]}], "1_submissions": [{"7ad6n9": [{"0_Title": "How did you meet your plug ?", "1_Text": "I got 100 pack at a smaller Walmart for 12$ \ud83d\ude01", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "7b7r11": [{"0_Title": "Where to buy rigs ?", "1_Text": "I got 100 pack at a smaller Walmart for 12$ \ud83d\ude01", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "7gs825": [{"0_Title": "Black tloaties", "1_Text": "I got 100 pack at a smaller Walmart for 12$ \ud83d\ude01", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "7ikexy": [{"0_Title": "Pick up for the weekend. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc96", "1_Text": "I got 100 pack at a smaller Walmart for 12$ \ud83d\ude01", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "7tfyqq": [{"0_Title": "Makeup tutorials giving me cravings", "1_Text": "I got 100 pack at a smaller Walmart for 12$ \ud83d\ude01", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "8923ib": [{"0_Title": "Micron filters", "1_Text": "I got 100 pack at a smaller Walmart for 12$ \ud83d\ude01", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}]}]}]}
