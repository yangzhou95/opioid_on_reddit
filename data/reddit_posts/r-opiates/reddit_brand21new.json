I remember not smelling amazing, deodorant helped as far as the smell, I reapplied a plethora of different scented deodorants during the day, but wasn't competently prefect.

Day 4 came and I was so anxious because I had to stop my benzos, took a few MG of sub and a few gabapentin (not much) and was a lot better. I'd say I was good enough to go out and do things for my little week of WD. I swear by gabapentin for a lot of things. Love it. I've never been one for subs, just took probably 5 mg/day this withdrawal, worked for me. So,  a moderate amount of a benzo, maybe some clonidine or stomach med, sub, and you'll be good. I like to wrap myself up so I can sweat as much as possible through the night. For me, after a night, I no longer get the chill/hot flip. Not perfect but I don't expect withdrawal to ever be.
