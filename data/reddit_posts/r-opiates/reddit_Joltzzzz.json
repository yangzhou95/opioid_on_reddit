BUT, in my area hardly anybody can even find pills on the black market, the days of pill mills and free-flowing scripts are long over. 5-10 years ago they were everywhere. Today, that's not the case, pills are hard/impossible to find but H is everywhere. So, I'm guessing that the percentage of scripts being flipped for cash is pretty damn low and shouldn't be a major concern of yours. \nThat said, I'm a long-term pain patient, almost 10 years, and my scripts straight-up make my life livable. They don't kill the pain completely, just back it off enough to stop the suicidal thoughts. So, thanks for being one of the few MDs still willing to help cp patients. \nThe direction our country is going with treatment of pain is terrifying to ppl like me - ppl with debilitating 24/7 pain and no treatment options except for opioid therapy. Every day online I read posts from pain patients who can't find treatment and are left crippled considering suicide or street drugs. \nI'll add I used to \"party\" before I got sick, and I like to read this sub, but pain is a huge buzz-kill.

Where r the black market/DNM pills coming from today? The OP in this post mentions a dboy; I've seen reports of ppl getting busted with thousands of pills in hand. That's not a diverted script, ya know? I personally think it's organised crime syndicates. \nBack in the day, my ppl got their stock from pill mills. Those are 100% gone now. You might have the odd, broke older person selling their script today, but every last addict I know who tried to work a doctor either failed to get a script or eventually got booted - failed UA, one too many lost/stolen scripts, just basic addict shit that eventually shows itself. \nI'm in a major city and black market pills are *really* hard to come by, my ppl still in the game have turned to H. Imo, the pill epidemic is and has been over. We now have a heroin epidemic, cause addicts are gonna addict regardless.

At 1am, I finally broke and I made the call, set up a pick-up, and now found myself on the 3am desolate, empty interstate, for the moment not another car in sight. I was busy beating myself up and longing for the relief a few pills would bring. \n\"Holy Shit! What the actual fuck is that!\" I shouted to my empty car as the entire sky suddenly lit up, a blue-tinted, bright light illuminated everything as far as I could see. The luminescent glow lasted almost 15 seconds, and then quickly faded and everything went dark. And, I do mean *everything* went dark... no streetlights, no ambient light from the houses that line the interstate... just nothing but darkness and the light of the sliver moon. I pulled to the side as my car started to putter to a stop. My first thought was \"goddamnit, how am I gonna get to Gavin's house now?!?\" My second thought was \"They better fix this shit quick.\" I naively thought it was some huge electric/internet grid outage that fried my car, but that it would be quickly repaired. I wasn't worried. Yet. \nI climbed out of my car and felt the crisp chill of the late night air, shivered and popped my trunk thinking I had an old sweatshirt in there... no luck, just my friend's forgotten golf clubs and an old box cutter. \nI looked slowly around, finally taking it all in. It was so unbelievably dark... and so unbelievably quiet. As an afterthought, I grabbed the box cutter and shoved it in my pocket. Then, I closed the trunk, locked the car and started walking. \nAs I trudged glumly along, miserable, I crafted my plan. I'd made this 150 mile trek many times and knew it well. I was thrilled to be only two miles out from Gavin's exit, and he lived in an old, beat-up neighbourhood close to the highway. By the time I hiked to his house and picked up, the power would be back up. I could deal with the car then, it probably just needed a jump. Not ideal, but definitely doable. \nI pulled out my phone to call Gavin and tell him I was gonna be late and to hold them pills. Much to my surprise, my phone was dead, too. Finally my mind strayed from the task at hand and I thought of something other than the pills. \nThis was an outage like none I'd ever seen. Cars, phones, lights, every.last.thing was off. There was no hum of cars and electronics in the distance, it was eerily quiet. \nAt that moment, I heard a long, high-pitched scream far off in the distance, it sounded human but I found myself deciding it was a coyote. I instinctively wrapped my hand around the box cutter, shivered, and picked up my pace to that of a slow jog... *god damnit*, Gavin better be fucking home and still holding.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "diil599": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I think theres a poppy plant growing out of my sink.

It makes zero sense to force them out to find pain relief. \nI believe by withholding addiction treatment or maintenance while in the hospital, you are leaving the patient in pain, incredibly stressing their already infected body and forcing them to seek relief - *relief*, not a high - elsewhere.
