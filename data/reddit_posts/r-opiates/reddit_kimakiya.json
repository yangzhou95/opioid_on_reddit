How have you been since, physically, emotionally and mentally?", "1_Text": "TL;DR - I got drowned by a crazy bitch while her mother watched(8/9yo) and I was in a drug/gang shoot out in Ecuador with family and we never talk about it(10/11yo).\n\nI was sleeping over a distant family's house since I was close to their daughter and their son had just died. I was there to play and comfort her. She was always a little weird but then again so was I so I never thought much of it. The mom was a dead woman walking so we were able to do whatever as long as we didn't enter her brother's room; which I did and it was untouched except for Jesus candles, everywhere. \n\nAnyways, the next day, I was supposed to stay the whole weekend, we decided to go for a swim. I'm a weak swimmer but I just like to do laps and chill. As I'm doing my own thing, she comes up behind me and shoves my head down underwater. I thought she wanted to play until a good 15-30 seconds pass and I start flailing and trying to push her. I started seeing black spots and I opened my mouth and the rush of water hurt sooooo bad. It felt like an eternity and I was terrified.  \n\nWhat scared me the most was her mom watched this happened as I saw her looking at us before she pushed my head in. I guess it took her a bit to click back on and she rushed outside to pull me out and then started to blame me for it. I was coughing and vomiting water while this crazy lady is screaming about what I did and why. I told her what her daughter did and she went full robot again and denied it and was like \"ur crazy\" aka gas lighting me. \n\nI showered and then told her I wanted to check in with my mom. I went to the bathroom and told her to come pick me up, now.  I was around 8/9 yrs old. She was 11. My mom believed me and was there in less than 30 minutes. \n\nI guess because she didn't want to get caught or something, the mom gave me new clothes and did my hair for when my mom picked me up. I never went back. \n\nAlso: Was in Ecuador in the back of a pick up truck with some cousins and we were just chilling with their friends. As soon as they get into their car/taxi this moped/shitty motorcycle pulls up and starts making it rain bullets. I just remember hearing one pass between all of us in the back like a zyooooom and then my head hit the bed as my sister pushed up down. \n\nFuck are guns loud as shit. We waited until we heard the guys go and the motorcycle leave. Between the screams and people gathering, my cousin(who was driving and high as shit as they'd been hotboxing) pulled the fuck out, I got to see the taxi that was next to us with their friends. There was just glass and blood everywhere and people just taking pictures. Saw a picture and the story the next day on the newspaper. None of us there spoke about it since we knew we'd never be able to go out again.
