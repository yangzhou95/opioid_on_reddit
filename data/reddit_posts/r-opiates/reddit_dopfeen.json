Because that'll destroy your liver.\n\nTaking that much codeine is unnecessary for migraines, plus there's other non-opiate drugs for migraines, just switch to something else. \n\nYou don't sound physically addicted at the moment but you're heading towards an addiction for sure, so I'd stop now or you'll end up trying stronger opiates and it'll just spiral from there. Completely stopping and never using again may seem like the hardest thing in the world right now but the longer you use the harder it gets. \n\nSeriously, you've realized that you have a problem earlier than most so quit before it gets out of control. I started with codeine at 16 too, next came heroin, spiraled into an insane fentanyl addiction, before I knew I'd destroyed my mental health, had multiple overdoses, got in trouble with the police, lost friends that got into it with me to this shit, and finally had a massive seizure detoxing from carfentanyl and in hosptial got told that most of my organs were functioning minimally before I finally quit. 19 now clean for a few months still crave it all the time, it escalates really fucking fast, so I advise you stop.", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "dt51x9k": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Help me make the perfect fap", "1_Text": "Adderall adderall adderall adderall", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "dt66v94": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Men, where's the worst place that you've had an erection?", "1_Text": "Inside your mom", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dulpqzz": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Drug Review: Diethyl Ether", "1_Text": "Ether makes you nauseous if you do enough", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "dulptqk": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Drug Review: Diethyl Ether", "1_Text": "Try soaking a rag in 10-15ml and immediately inhaling straight through the rag, totally different experience", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "dvaaxiu": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What's the most worthless, yet irritating thing that a thief could steal in a home robbery?", "1_Text": "I spent longer looking through this sub just now than I'd like to admit", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dvjucbv": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What is the most \"adult\" thing you have ever done?", "1_Text": "I'm 20 and I've done this", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dvjv076": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Teenagers of Reddit, what is something you want to ask adults of Reddit?", "1_Text": "You don't.
