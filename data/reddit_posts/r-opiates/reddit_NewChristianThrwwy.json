I saw no mention of this being attempted by her. It put a bad taste in my mouth. At least wait for the verdict to be light or her to blame it on a guy before you go off and claim this. Otherwise it's like screaming there's a fire when there isn't one. In fact, I think I saw in that article that she was going to be sentenced for a long duration. \n\nA lot of men's rights is like this unfortunately. Especially when rape cases get posted here. A lot here seem to think that rape cases are oftentimes false claims, and honestly that is not good because if you cherry pick and choose the cases where the woman lied about being raped, then that makes it a lot harder for other women who *have* been raped to be believed. It makes it harder for *all* victims regardless of gender to be believed.
