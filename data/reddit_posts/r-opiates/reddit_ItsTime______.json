They are already doing this with the #Stopthespiral campaign. Lets be real here--kratom will never be suggested as a viable alternative to suboxone or methadone maintenance. I have no doubts that we are at the apex of kratom's free for all leaglity. \n\nWhat this community should be doing is demystifying the lies about kratom *and* opioids. For every person here who benefits from kratom, there are an equal amount, if not more, amount of people who benefit from conventional opioid therapy under controlled conditions.\n\nLets not demonize opiates as a whole here, it's a disgusting farce I see trending on this subreddit all too often. The ChronicPain subreddit is experiencing a new horizon of suffering because of vocal addicts who may or may not have had a legitimate reason to use opiates dismissing them as the succubuses of the 21st century.\n\n\nThe focal point of this 'opiate epidemic' isn't even the tried and tested opioids like morphine or oxycodone; it's fentanyl and the innapropriate use of benzodiazepines alongside illicit cut up street heroin. This is why the east coast experinces more overdoses than those who use black tar in the west. It's often because east coast powder is a mix of antihistamines, fentanyl analogues, other random pontentiators and a little bit of heroin- and to top it off tobacco and the occasional benzodiazepine. In this sense heroin is like kratom, they could have a dozen drugs in their system at death but heroin will be the sole culprit.\n\nBecause of kratom's abundance of alkaloids and the multiple MOA's of MIT alone--kratom will not be optimal for everyone. Instead of the governement allocating funds for methadone clinics and suboxone docs they should learn from more sane countries like switzerland or canada, and open up diapmorphine/hydrpmorphine clinics that dispense a controlled amount of either opioid twice a day. \n\n\nEveryone seeking this type of therapy should undergoe a mandatory sleep study to screen for central or obstuctive sleep apnea. They shoul.d also be open about any allergies they might have or other breathing disroders such as asthma. \n\nMy point being that kratom should not be preached as the only superior treatment- because it clearly isn't and the hysteria behing opiates is absurd to put it lightly. The hysteria is a lethal one as bupe or done' will never provide the sustanence the addicts are looking for so they will often relapse and get a fent bag and die. This is true for kratom as well. Most heroin addicts will not find kratom to be a form of maintenance but rather a bridge to their next relapse.\n\n\nI feel like this kratom community and the AKA/BEA are selfishly looking out for themselves because they have got something that works fotthem so they dismiss this potentially game changing modalitiy entirely. \n\n\n\nEDIT: Can't edit spelling because im using my xbox controller to type and it's erasing the words I want to edit.

I have made it 4 years, it will probably be 5 or 6 years before I start using kratom religiously again. \n\n\n> Like saying take an aspirin a week after your head-ache has passed...\n\n\nI see what you're saying but most opioid addicts will be plagued with recurrent cravings (depending on life quality of course). I think if one sets a goal like: \"i'll get clean from all opioids [including kratom] now and work on optimizing my body's health and functioning and then return 2-3+ years later to help me cope with future stressors\", it will be much easier to stay clean and have something to look forward to in case shit hits the fan. \n\nI mean yeah if you think about it, if you're 2-3+ years out why would you start back on kratom, but 90% of people I know who I used to smoke dope with are chronic relapsers even after a couple years clean. I have the most clean time out of anyone I have ever used with; the only people I have met with more clean time than me are those I meet at NA meetings.", "2_Subreddit": "Kratomm"}]}]}]}
