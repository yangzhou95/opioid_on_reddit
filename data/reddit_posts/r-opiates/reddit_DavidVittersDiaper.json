The fact that you believe that women get off on denying you sex is probably the source of your unhappiness. You're not a victim because women won't sleep with you. They won't sleep with you because you see sex as this weird power struggle in which you are the perpetually victimized loser.

You say that sub has tainted your perception and you are right. Get out while you are still self-aware enough to realize that. \n\n2) This \"vicious cycle\" thing you are describing is a total myth. You do not need friends to make friends. People will absolutely be your friends. The only reason you believe that they wont is because you currently freak them out with the self loathing and sexism that are inherent to the incels philosophy. There are even people on this sub telling you to PM them if you need to talk despite your ugly view of the world. Imagine how many more people would be willing to talk to you if you if adopted a healthy outlook on relationships, sex, and social interaction. \n\nPeople do not want to be befriend people that whine and moan about how socially inept they are. Even if you are miserable, people will hang out with you if you just pretend to be happy/normal.
