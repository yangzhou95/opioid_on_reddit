They're such great, amazing and polite kids, they're definitely the best thing I've ever done in my life.\n\nI'm a little different in the fact that NOBODY ever knew/knows I ever had a drug problem, no one.  I was able to hide it very well and opened and ran my own business.  I was extremely lucky.  I started out in pain management (like so, many others) after the birth of my 2nd kid and my Dr. got busted and I tried to cold turkey off of fentanyl patches myself.  Bad idea, I honestly had no idea about wds, I'm dead serious, I thought I was dying. Badically, in a nut shell, it led me to full blown addiction and was brutal.  My wds last forever 3+ weeks of every symptom imaginable.  Couldn't function, obviously, so I got on methadone.  Been clean ever since, asides from the 'done obviously.  It's honestly saved my life in so many ways.  It gets such a bad rap but I consider myself one of the better, success stories from it.\n\nBeen divorced for over 2 years now and am so thankful I don't have to ever be in that shitty relationship again, asides from dealing with him in regards to my kiddos.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwt0l2b": [{"0_Comment Submission": "A SFW Boof Time!", "1_Text": "Oof, stop picking at them and go get a good natural mani w/o any polish.  Maybe a very light buff at the end but that's about it.  Also grab some good cuticle oil, Solar Oil by CND is the absolute best and smells yummy to boot!

Seriously, it's hard to admit and realize you need help, even if it's just to a bunch of Internet strangers. ;)\n\nYou obviously know you need help, it's just so, damn hard to know what the, best and right, next step is in regards to sobriety.  Its such an obvious cliche but taking it 1 day, fuck, one hour at a time, is truly helpful and correct with so many of us.\n\nTrying to wrap your head around all of it is so stressful and confusing, especially in the beginning.  Our brains are our worst enemies and will come up with all kids of ways to sabotage any/all progress.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of \"self help\" books but there's one that has helped me so much, both in the past, present and future.  I can't remember the exact name of it buts I think it's called \"The Power of the Sub-Concious Mind\" or something along those lines.  It's a really fascinating look into how we only use like 10% of our brains on the daily and that we have the potential to tap into so much more if we just try.  Excellent excerpts of real people explaining how well the book has helped them, including addicts, and was written by Dr's.\n\nAnyways, just thought I'd throw that at ya!  \n\nBest of luck to you, just remember you are NEVER alone and you are so much stronger than you think you are.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwtj6v3": [{"0_Comment Submission": "A SFW Boof Time!", "1_Text": "Grow da fuq up.\n\nEdit:  \n\nStop being such a douchebag troll also.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwtjc40": [{"0_Comment Submission": "A SFW Boof Time!", "1_Text": "Why the hell does her post piss you off so much?  \n\nYou need to get laid stat.
