It\u2019s normal to want things to progress at a normal pace, and her pace with you for whatever reason is definitely very fast. It\u2019s good you brought up how you feel about this, but admittedly worrisome that she got upset rather than understanding/ realizing that she\u2019s objectively coming off very strong. Even if she feels these ways, the timeline of things makes it a little inappropriate to convey them to you, in my opinion. I think a more reassuring reaction would have been to acknowledge your feelings, register what you said, and try to reel it in a bit to make you more comfortable (which isn\u2019t asking for too much).\n\nMoving forward, I think if you like her, go out for another date and see if she continues to behave that way. If she doesn\u2019t, good! She\u2019d be being considerate of your discomfort with her moving in really fast emotionally.

Exactly like being way too stoned, which was super bizarre because she hadn\u2019t smoked, and her partner who also used from the same batch was also experiencing the same thing. They told me they ended up tossing the rest of their bags from that batch and never went back. This was a month or two ago, and they only ran into it that one time. Something odd tho was that they had picked up from that set prior, and that very same stamp had been \u201cnormal\u201d during past pickups, and then suddenly one day the same stamp from the same set caused that bizarre new reaction. They\u2019d even tried a few more bags from that bundle to test if it was the bags or their imagination, and they got the same reaction/ confirmed it was that particular batch. She told me it was extremely unpleasant and that nothing at all helped because even trying to sleep it off sent her into a panic attack/ existential crisis/ complete mental breakdown.
