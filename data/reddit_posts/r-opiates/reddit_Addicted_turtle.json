Also the realization that happiness is never permanent.  Its fleeting and you gotta work so fucking hard for it.... i was doing great for a long time but still suffered a lot during.  I got my own place, new car, new job, long term girlfriend.  I heavily invested in my new hobby, indoor rock climbing.  Im in an extremely hard spot now... it all started several months ago... Shit, almost a year ago now.  I gave kratom a try and found a strain that straight up felt like a fistfull of vics... thats when my body and mind remembered oh hey, i can feel happy as hell without all the work.  I dabbled from time to time and then four months ago i bought two large bags and began daily consumption... and i took a shit ton.  It followed every path every drug ever has with me - gradual procession to extreme consumption and where all the negatives raged amd positives are all but gone. Finally i quit.  Shortly after i lost my decent paying job.  It wasnt my fault though, for the first time ever.  Just part of life and a companies downsizing.  Oh, and did i mention not long after i found kratom i decided a cup and binge watching game of thrones was more important than my new passion, rock climbing... so long story short im now sober, on the job hunt, but extremely depressed and its excruciatingly slow progress.  I know how to be happy again though.  And i have a hell of a lot more than when i started this sobriety journey... thats the thing though, there is no stagnate - if i stop pursuing my goals and ambitions its not a pause, its rewinding back to missery and addiction.  Also, keep in mind, life fucking sucks and its hard as hell.  It never gets easier... but it does get better.\nSorry for the story but ill tell you one thing and remind myself at the same time - when i started i had a shitty car, lived with my mom, and hard withdrawels, self loathing, and misery to wake up to every morning.  Im miserable and will experience much more misery. But here i sit, about two years in, at home, my home, reading with my son who i now have majority custody of, next to my dog who i love who was rescued from the pound by my gorgeous girlfriend, who will be home later to love me, and enough money in my account that though it hurts losing my job i have savings - savings i have and will keep because its not spent on the bottle or the bag... please, feel free to ask more if you want - lord knows i have time lol", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dvtoznd": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Still accidentally clean", "1_Text": "Just a heads up, kratom is a bitch to quit too and is a real drug that can definitely fuck with your life and body.", "2_Subreddit": "PoppyTea"}], "dvuhexu": [{"0_Comment Submission": "When your long time Oxy connect suddenly connect leaves the game...", "1_Text": "Nah bra - da best, fish scale, pure raw white gurl... hate those fucks, every single thing is \"absolute fire\".
