Opiates do change the way the brain works and its the addict stealing not sober her but she chose drugs over withdrawal by stealing.  Many many people dont turn to stealing to get their drug. So i think its more a sign of the person's morals and not just the addict in them.\n\nFor example my parents always have around 1k in cash at their house. I know where it has by accidentally finding it while helping them move some things. They have no idea i know its there so i could easily steal it and claim ignorance. Especially cuz they often leave their door unlocked when they leave giving me the break in excuse. I have suffered through many days of withdrawal knowing that money is there. O could even just take like 50 bucks and pay it back and they'd never known. But I DONT and never will cuz it doesnt belong to me.
