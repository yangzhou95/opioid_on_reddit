When that doesn\u2019t work and I\u2019m still struggling for half an hour, I take a hot, steaming shower. \n\nI hold my arms together, outward and under the shower water, I make sure the water directly hits the area of my veins and I clench my fists. The water doesn\u2019t have to be painfully hot, just hot enough to your comfort.  \n\nI do this throughout my shower for at least 2 minutes or 5 or until I feel like i\u2019m ready. This has worked wonders for me, I inject as soon as I get out of the shower and dry my arms off. I\u2019m able to hit a vein on the first shot. I have tried running my arms under hot water on the sink as an alternative but I haven\u2019t had luck. And my skin feels softer too when I inject after the hot shower method. \n\nI usually do this after I get fed up with looking but I suggest you do it first and than start getting in there.  If you have a detachable shower head it\u2019ll be more convenient to just run the water on your arm. \n\nAlso, I try flailing my arms like a pinwheel to the best of my ability. My bathroom is small so it\u2019s hard to do a complete circle in the shower. I read that it helps sometimes but I haven\u2019t tried it by itself without the shower.\n\nI definitely get the frustration when you can\u2019t find a vein, I once got so worked up and sweaty, I almost had an anxiety attack and I was trying for nearly an hour. I\u2019ve had better luck when someone else does it for me but half the time I don\u2019t have access to another helping hand. \n\nThe shower method has been the second closest thing to having someone do it for me lol. It\u2019s a learning process but you\u2019ll get it. You should take breaks in between try\u2019s and using a new needle after piercing a few times can help. Stay hydrated and relaxed when you\u2019re looking for veins. I hope you\u2019re able to find something that works for you soon!", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwmw821": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Just out of curiosity", "1_Text": "Black, Latina, Native American here", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}]}], "1_submissions": [{"6320jz": [{"0_Title": "I can't be helped and I can't receive it", "1_Text": "since middle school, I'm in my last year of highschool", "2_Subreddit": "SuicideWatch"}], "6b1yqi": [{"0_Title": "Being alive is mentally painful", "1_Text": "since middle school, I'm in my last year of highschool", "2_Subreddit": "SuicideWatch"}], "6bdj4y": [{"0_Title": "tomorrow might be the day", "1_Text": "since middle school, I'm in my last year of highschool", "2_Subreddit": "SuicideWatch"}], "6fdtww": [{"0_Title": "Being blackmailed", "1_Text": "since middle school, I'm in my last year of highschool", "2_Subreddit": "rape"}], "6fxbe8": [{"0_Title": "Child abuse", "1_Text": "since middle school, I'm in my last year of highschool", "2_Subreddit": "legaladviceofftopic"}], "6osgfk": [{"0_Title": "Pennsylvania, US.
