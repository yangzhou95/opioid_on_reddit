I\u2019ve been wanting to lower my dose on my own, but it\u2019s hard. I always tell myself I\u2019m going to do it, but I always come up with excuses. I need to come up with a plan like yours and just stick to it. I need to supplement my rx with extras I buy every month. The last couple of months I would have to drastically lower my dosage the last week before my refill so I wouldn\u2019t run out. But at least this month I\u2019m taking them so that won\u2019t happen. My connect I buy from will be moving away next month, so I\u2019ll really have no choice but to lower it down to where I can be comfortable with my own meds. I only know that one person to buy from and don\u2019t know how else to get the extras that I need. So, I\u2019ll have to come up with that plan soon, and stick to it!
