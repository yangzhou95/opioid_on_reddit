Throw pills in a shot glass\n2. Fill shot glass with water (distilled water is best - water impurities can keep the APAP in solution).\n3. Let pills sit for a minute or two and they'll fully dissolve\n4. Stir\n5. Pour through two pre-wetted coffee filters (doubled-up for extra strength and filtering)\n6. Carefully squeeze filters to get the precious hydro solution out. Don't squeeze too hard while there is still liquid in the filters or the side will burst and spray your precious yield everywhere. Once all the liquid is squeezed out, twist the filters on top to make them look like a tootsie pop wrapper. Then squeeze the filters/APAP solids with the force of God to get every last drop out.
