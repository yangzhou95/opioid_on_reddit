I did watch a documentary the other day that followed around a bunch of poppy growers in Mexico and he said straight up they add it in and showed how they mix it with a coffee grinder and straight said everyone does it now days becuase if you don\u2019t you loose what little profit they make so if that\u2019s the case it\u2019s coming premixed from the start of the chain before it\u2019s even brought down to the major cities in Mexico waaaay before border crossing. I think someone said the name of the show was \u201cthe trade\u201d and is based in Guerrero (probably spelling error) which is a heavily contested plaza which is currently ran by El Mencho\u2019s crew. \n\nMencho or Tio was born in Mexico and then came to Northern California where he lived both in Fresno and San Francisco\u2019 where he was detained and deported twice for heroin sells cases. He gets out of prison and sent back where he then funny enough becomes a police officer and then a sicario. He was the one who kidnapped chapos sons and would have killed them had chapos long time friend El Mayo who is believed to be the real leader behind the known face of chapo.

With the panda maybe becuase they are stronger I found that if I take more I just nod out and I\u2019ve never nodded out standing up straight in the middle of the day until a panda but it was like within a week they were almost pointless and my tolerance just shot up so why the occasional panda is a fun time for me at least they aren\u2019t cracked up what they are supposed to be and people just give them that rep becuase they are hard to get and when they do it\u2019s like a bragging point or maybe they are shooters but i can say as someone who only eats and snorts 9 out of 10 times id still take oxy.  I\u2019d go with panda if I just wanted to sleep or something but it\u2019s not something i would take then go hang out with some friends that\u2019s for sure.  Now i just save them for some special occasion and end up taking them with some Hydrocodone so that way i have the fucked up and euphoria mixed ( think it\u2019s like the Dilly\u2019s and are more for shooters or something i know I had been feeling like shit and taken a couple and i remember thinking damn this doesn\u2019t even feel like a few Norco\u2019s and had it not taken the WD away at least I would have been mad haha!)", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwh6qqs": [{"0_Comment Submission": "This is seriously the worst forum to look when sick BUT the best when HIGH!!

I know quite a few people who are that way becuase I live an area where they aren\u2019t hard to get pandas are only 15 a pop and a 30mg Roxy or the likes is 10-15 a pop. Only pay 3 bucks per 10mg Norco and 4 for 10mg perc. I\u2019ve had my couple little binges on them becuase if a nice break is between them the euphoria comes back but I don\u2019t get the same satisfaction as when i take perc or Norco ( just took 20 yellows for breakfast ) and I have no trouble handling the panda I just the enjoyment factor was gone. I\u2019m sure if I was into the Nod i would love them but opiates are an upper for me I take a handful and then I\u2019m in a great mood talkative feeling warm. That only lasts for the first day or two with the panda where as the others If the fun goes away I just take more. Wasn\u2019t really the case so that could be my bodies chemical make up which is why they legit tell you not to take other peoples meds becuase they do affect different body chemistry differently and reactions are different. I have friends that can function of tons of bars meanwhile i can\u2019t take a half 1mg without blacking out for 3 days. It seems the people that hold this pill so high up is on this sub. If you talk to real people most don\u2019t even like them and feel the way I do. Maybe its supply and demand also the placebo effect is huge. If you believe they are from god becuase you read it every day it it\u2019s either gonna be the greatest or the greatest let down and I could say I honestly didn\u2019t see anything special about them compared to anything else :) ( the placebo effect is enough for women to start producing milk and lactating if they truly believed they were pregnant even though they weren\u2019t which is why when they test meds you hear it\u2019s against a placebo and all that is basically a blank sugar pill so they can compare peoples reaction to the drug when they don\u2019t know if they are getting the real drug or not and some people end up say loosing weight or something becuase they believe they are on the pill. Also most people don\u2019t have easy access to them so if they were far and few in between and expensive then maybe if my experience was based off having enough for like one dosage a month or something then I might feel the same way but as someone who can choose what to take I would say I would not be taking pandas everyday so maybe that\u2019s why the majority feel the other way idk?", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwh8trx": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Do doctors ever prescribe oxy for chronic migraines?", "1_Text": "Go in and tell them your balls hurt too much and you can\u2019t fuck your old lady and she\u2019s gonna leave you.
