The sub doctors always start people on crazy huge doses because they don't really know very much about it. They take a 3 hour online class to prescribe it, and I'm pretty sure they get kickbacks from different sub formula makers. I'm sorry, but I don't think you should go anywhere near methadone, I'm on it, and it took me a long time to get on it because dealing with the clinic every day and all the side effects of methadone are super annoying if there is ANY other option. But I was shooting 1-2 gs of fent dope daily. I don't think people with under 200mg oxy habits a day should even be considered for methadone. \n\nI know this seems like the opposite of what you want to do, but cut your sub dose, dramatically. You can get by on 2mg or even less a day, and it will work far better than 16mgs ever has for you, I promise. When you use tiny doses of bupe, it doesn't coat your receptors completely, which allows the metabolized version, norbuprenorephine, to attach to some of those receptors. Unlike bupe, norbupe is a full agonist, so it will give you a bit more opiate feeling and help a lot more with cravings than plain bupe. At least try it before taking the methadone plunge, please", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dw4ul47": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Relatively inexperienced, insufflation vs oral.", "1_Text": "Oral is the way to go with oxy, it has a higher bioavailability that way than intranasal.
