Being 8, I thought it was super cool for whatever reason, so I crawled downstairs and into the kitchen. My mom saw me and I said \"check it out, my legs dont work.\" Well after another couple minutes I was fine, up and walking around. Though my mom was worried, she sent me to school. I collapsed during class, walking to my desk, so the school contacted my mom. She came and picked me up, took me to my pediatrician. He examined me briefly then told my mom to IMMEDIATELY drive me about an hour to a world-class hospital, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in NH. I was admitted. That night, I stopped breathing on my own and was put on a ventilator. I also became 100% paralyzed about an hour after arrival, full body paralysis. Turns out I had a rare disease, Guillian-Barre Syndrome. Because I was so young and had some other minor health issues, it was acute onset, rendering me paralyzed. It took months of rehabilitation once my nerves started regrowing, but now I am 26 and not paralyzed in any way, full mobility, no lasting motor skill damage. I owe my life to that doctor. I would have died at home had it not been for him.
