Sorry to hear about your Mum, mine has similar issues related with spine and other bones/muscles. She is prescribed Fentanyl for pain and Hydromorphone for breakthrough pain. After years of oxycodone use, she needed to take a ludicrous amount of pills to counter effect all of the side effects of the painkillers. Here in the Great White North, we have legal Medicinal CBD which I was prescribed first for adhd/anxiety issues. I introduced my mum to cbd alongside her painkiller dose and she found she was able to eliminate the vast majority of her other medication that balanced out the negatives of the opioids. As we all know, each of the balancing medications have a host of side effects of their own and now she has been shed of many pill shaped burdens. I believe you can find success with CBD if used alongside her painkiller that she is using. It not only helps balance the negatives of opioids but also reduces the withdrawal symptoms especially nausea, restless leg, and insomnia. CBD can lesson certain types of pain especially nerve and joint pain, but for bone pain I don\u2019t believe it can replace the gold standard of pain relief opioids offer. But I personally have seen the positive benefits of using both CBD and opioids together. Good luck to you and your mum!", "2_Subreddit": "CBD"}], "duni75e": [{"0_Comment Submission": "CBD, ADD + side effects", "1_Text": "Hey there, fellow Adult ADHD here. I too use cannabis for my symptoms and I have it prescribed. My doctor taught me about CBD and I have been a advocate since! I feel that my symptoms are lessened dramatically by using CBD and I get no high or red eyes from it at all. Actually it feels the opposite of a high and more like Sober+. Being able to think clearly and not be constantly sabotaged by my mind is worth the cost of CBD. I honestly have yet to find a negative symptom from using it.

Been using once a week for 4 months now. Been chipping pills for 4 years until they became unavailable and expensive or in my area fake and dangerous. A way that I personally have found I can deal with my cravings throughout the week is with CBD. Before being prescribed cannabis a year and a half ago I would find myself in the same trap as everyone else; buy as much as can afford, run until it\u2019s all gone and then get sick. Once I started using CBD regularly I noticed a number of conditions including my cravings for opiates have become manageable. It\u2019s still not easy as I still do crave but there is a huge difference in my abilities to chip while using CBD. I know many people are touting its abilities and many are skeptical but I have felt and seen the benefits it can provide. This includes withdrawals as well believe it or not. I really try to be disciplined when it comes to my use but for times I slip up and have a week run, the CBD shatters my insomnia, nausea, sweats and that muscle spasm skin crawling feeling.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dutnod0": [{"0_Comment Submission": "A post for those \u201cchipping\u201d", "1_Text": "Yes I like to use 1:1 strains like CBD Kush and Cannatonic.
