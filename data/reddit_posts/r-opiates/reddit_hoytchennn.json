Wd sucks. No ifs and or buts about it. And it's different for everyone. Some people can quit cold turkey, some need rehab, some don't ever get the chance to quit. But me personally here ya go. Started off having hydro 5/500 scribed from a knee Injury 6 years ago. Ever since then, took any opiate I could. Went to pain mgmt and now have had a mthly script for hydro 7.5/325 (90). Which I usulsy go thru in about a week. Then a week of hell. I find more from one of my connects and then get mine refilled etc. Every month for 2 years. I love opiates man. They make me happy, energized, social. And I guess that's why they are so deadly. I'm 9 days clean and it sucks to be honest. But I know it gets better. For me it's immodium, Nyquil to sleep, vivarin during the day (caffeine pills). Lots and lots of water. It may not work for everyone, but it does for me. It's not a daily struggle for me right now.

I would go to friends house after they had surgery or some medical issue to \"check on them\" but was really looking for their meds. I can slip opiates into any conversation to check my surroundings to open a new connect. I've had RLS from WD so bad that I took everything I could think of to stop it, including my partners meds that he needs for MS. I've used food money to buy pills. I've used bill money for pills. At times I would drive 2 hours away for pills but wouldn't take my son to the store for a damn Gatorade. My last but from a connect, was a ripoff. Took money and ran. And instead of coming home and admitting defeat, I sat at a gas station for 4 hours waiting. Making an excuse every time my kid or fiance called. I've went out in a flood, ice, left work without telling anyone for pills. I've stolen pills from people's house while I was a maid. I lost my nursing license from drug addiction. (Not stealing pills, but being too fucked up to function. I've become so angry without them that I have screamed at family and friends.
