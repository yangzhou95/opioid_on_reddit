I spent a few days researching different protein sources because whey protein makes me break out, and I can't afford to get all of my protein from meat. (At least meat that isn't pumped with antibiotics and salt water) \nAnyway, I saw a few articles that claimed that animal based protein were the \"best\" due to the high amino acid profile when compared to most non-animal protein sources. Although sources claim soy-beans, buckwheat, and quinoa are \"complete\" proteins due to not lacking certain amino acids like other vege protein sources. \n\nFrom what I could find online, It seems that the *only* reason other non-animal proteins such as beans, legumes, peas, oats, rice, other grains, etc., are *not* considered complete proteins, is because for the recommended *single* serving of each food listed, you do not meet the RDA for certain amino acids (like you would with animal protein). Nowhere online did I find information against my hypothesis that eating more than a single serving of these non-animal proteins (in order to meet the RDA for the amino acids that they are low in)  would make them \"complete proteins\" since you would be consuming your RDA for each essential amino acid. \n\nThat being said, I decided that my protein would come from 180-240 grams of oats a day in the form of a weight-gain shake consumed between 2/3 meals. Oats (and most grains) are relatively low in lysine, methionine, threonine, leucine, and histidine. Yet when I bump the serving size up to 180-240g, all of my RDA for amino acids are met. Just incase though, I will be adding a scoop of pea protein isolate which helps supplement the low amino acids in grains and because It makes it easier to meet my daily protein goal without consuming another 120 grams of damn oats.", "2_Subreddit": "nutrition"}], "dwpgarj": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Spilt water on laptop keyboard last night, and now keys aren't working!", "1_Text": "spilled*", "2_Subreddit": "techsupport"}], "dwqrxw7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Hi, my name is Ryan Germick.
