Also, that\u2019s not to say that you shouldn\u2019t go to college at all, I do believe there is value in it, whether you use the degree or not. But I would suggest getting a more \u2018safe\u2019 degree, like business or something. I\u2019ve never wished my degree was in engineering, but I\u2019ve always thought a business degree would have given me some insight in how to do the business side of my freelance stuff better. \n\nAnd of course, if you were to go to one of those schools for music, you would come out a fuckin sick dirty shredder. All the people I know who have gone to those schools (I don\u2019t know how many of them are full time musicians) are all at least incredible players. It\u2019s just, the thing about music is, if you practice as much as those guys did you can be just as good. \n\nWe recently had a touring engineer come thru the venue I work at who was fresh out of Berklee for sound engineering and that kid had no idea what he was doing. He was the monitor engineer for a fairly popular band which I will not name. Not really sure how he even got the gig to begin with. Maybe he knew the technical concepts, but when it came to running a show, he flat out sucked. The best way to learn it is to do it. It seemed like my 6 or so years of personal education and real world experience absolutely crushed his 4 years from school.
