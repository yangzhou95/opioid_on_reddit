There are others in this very same thread that needed one last relic to finish and couldn't get it until spending well over 20-30k more shards.\n\nAt this point I tend to believe there are no escalating odds and it just boils down to luck (or bad luck).  Usually when Valve implements escalating odds into their reward mechanisms, they announce it as such but this time around there wasn't any indication or announcement that odds escalated the more relics you buy.
