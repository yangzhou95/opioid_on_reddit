I've always picked up the passenger at the requested time with no problem, however I do get annoyed with one thing... for example, I have a scheduled pick up for 10am.  So the app tells me to be online by 9:45 to accept the request. Ok, no problem.. except as soon as I sign on, I get requests from other passengers. Since I've already committed to the scheduled pick up, I have to decline any other requests, which lowers my acceptance rate.
