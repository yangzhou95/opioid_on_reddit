They told them that they had nothing to worry about because it's a well modded forum and they don't break any rules there. They did say it's good to let members know about the policy changes though and let people know they're gonna be more strict about anyone breaking that policy.\n\nIt's not even just sourcing that gets subs banned. Sourcing was big reason for many subs being banned, but for subs like DNM it wasn't sourcing. It was more of just mentioning vendors, mentioning specific markets, vendors being marked as such which made it easier for people to do DD's off site, and just a bunch of stuff like that.\n\nAlso all the forums for markets got banned like the Dream Market subs. People on there were asking which vendors had the best xyz, almost no moderating going on to take care of that stuff, and just in general massive amounts of illegal shit going on. The admins do not want the heat.\n\nR/opiates is a model example of what we want to do here. They still have an amazing sense of community there, and there's still tons of \"shit posting\" like dope porn and all that, but with that being said, it is an amazingly well modded forum. They make sure there's no sourcing or anything that can even be interpreted as sourcing. No even mentioning locations. No talking about specific DNM or vendors AT ALL. No vendors advertising there or even being marked as vendors. \n\nNo subreddit is perfect, and anything that has to deal with illegal substances is going to be controversial and occasionally break reddit rules. The good simply has to outweigh the bad by a lot, and r/opiates makes sure of that. It is a forum that's focused on harm reduction, and that's what we want to do here. We want a strong sense of community, to keep people safe, and we want to be here for a long time.

It seems like the big reason is that the profit margin simply isn't there for the labs, and instead of just raising the price they move on to the next compound they can make cheaply which seems to be PAF, although I've still yet to see anyone selling real legit PAF yet, so it's good to see you got a good batch. \n\nAlso, is PAF or PMAF or PPF even a real name for these analogues or is it completely made up?
