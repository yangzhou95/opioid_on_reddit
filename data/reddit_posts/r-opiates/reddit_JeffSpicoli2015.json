Needless to say it was a fucking massive collection. Wish I never started selling shit, FUCK YOU JIMMY you poor fuck, if it wasnt for you I wouldn't of. Sold some online and most to a comic shop, they were always lowballing the duck out of me. Ended up with probably $3k if added up from multiple sales after everything was gone.

Had the full Power Rangers SHF, all of the Iron Mans made (quit right before the SHF Iron Man 43/45 dropped) and more others. Had a bunch of Marvel Legends, WWE figures, Gunpla... Damn th is is making me so fucking sad. Collection was worth about $12-$14 thousand according to eBay sales. The best part was I started collecting with nothing!!
