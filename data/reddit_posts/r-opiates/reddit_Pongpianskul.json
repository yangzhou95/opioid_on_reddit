There are few conditions you can truthfully say this about, but withdrawal from heroin is one of them, thankfully.\n\nYou have gone through the worst now. You will start appreciating little things again soon. Music will start sounding very intense and moving. Life will stir inside you and hunger will return.

Life can be more enjoyable.\n\nTry Alteril for sleep - a mix of melatonin and herbal shit that actually works. L-theanine is a supplement that helps calm and soothe a bit. If you have access to marijuana, it can stimulate the appetite and sagging sense of humor. Being able to chuckle even once is extremely helpful and eating is a blessing too.\n\nExercise if you can.

No fear about anything. Your self doubts and distress would be alien too. Having true romantic interests is impossible for psychopaths because they cannot love or feel empathy. They know this and it hurts terribly.\n\nBelieve me, you don't want to live the empty, lonely, frustrating life of a real psychopath. It's not all blood and guts and murder.
