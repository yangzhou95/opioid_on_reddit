FBI tracks the purchase of most materials that can be used to make major bombs. The columbine shooters bombs failed with their attempt to detonate their bombs. It take much more preparation and the rudimentary bombs used by the recent bomber in Texas killed far fewer people.\n\nBut the supposition you seem to be making is that because people will still be able to kill people eliminating a tool designed specifically to kill people more easily won't make a difference and the obvious logical flaws in that argument should be self evident.", "2_Subreddit": "TopMindsOfReddit"}], "dwlu5f3": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Watch: In Unison, Sinclair\u2019s Local Stations Denounce \u2018One-Sided News Stories\u2019", "1_Text": "Reagan was the top before boomers started noticing the decline in America.

It also doesnt account for how much more work and technical skill would need to be had to successfully accomplish his goal of killing via those methods.\n\nIt is much simpler and therefore much more accessible for more individuals to simply use a firearm if their goal is to easily kill people. This is why legislation regulating fire arms will help decrease overall deaths. \n\nLike I said it is logically flawed for you to assume that banning or regulating a device designed to make killing easy won't have an effect on the over all amount of people killed. \n\nA gun is a tool designed for killing, a nailgun is a tool designed to drive nails into things. If nailguns were banned houses would still be built, but they would be built more slowly with less nails driven over time. That's why firearm regulation has successfully decreased gun crime in most of the other countries that have correctly implemented it.", "2_Subreddit": "TopMindsOfReddit"}], "dwn1vii": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Top Mind explains how access to certain items could cause greater death tolls, but refuses to accept that access to certain guns leads to greater death tolls", "1_Text": "Listen man your long Gish Gallup of nonsense did nothing to take my points away and your hostile tone and ad hominem attacks really just make you look kind of sad and petty here, but it does tell me there isnt much point in continuing this discussion with you so feel free to respond after this but I wont. So I'm just going to make a couple of points here and if you really do consider yourself as someone open to thinking critically I'll let you walk away with your own conclusion.\n\nI really don't need to explain to you how decreasing access to a tool designed to make killing a simple point and click process can decrease deaths but I will anyway. Your wand analogy is so far off base its ridiculous. So aside from me just pointing out the lack of logic in it here are some in depth studies about how regulation helps decrease deaths. It also shows how assault weapons legislation has had a positive effect on limiting deaths in mass shootings debunking your statement that previous legislation had no effect.\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2014.939367\n\nThat's from Marc Gius from Quinnepac University. Some of his previous studies have been touted by pro gun advocates for debunking other misconceptions about firearms so its hardly a biased or flawed source and the methodology and models for the study are well explained.\n\nFurther studies you can find from him will show that assault weapons bans do little to decrease overall gun violence but specifically decreases school shooting fatalities and injuries by more than 50%.\n\nNow as far as overall and more comprehensive gun control legislation lowering over all gun crime. Us Americans have both the most guns and the most gun related homicides, and homicides in general in the developed world. These two facts are very much related.\n\nHttps://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/38/1/140/2754868\n\nThis probably the most comprehensive study to date on the subject with sampling from 10 countries with 130 different studies. It shows without doubt that wide and varied measures from buybacks to more exclusive licensing measures all had a noticeable effect on decreasing gun crime.\n\nI could keep going dude but honestly you sound like some dumb teenager on the internet who got angry that he was wrong and shot back with a whole slew of piss poor projection so have a nice day.", "2_Subreddit": "TopMindsOfReddit"}], "dwn3fcx": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Pizzagate failed, so Top Minds tie (((Podesta))) emails to a child abduction.
