I stuck to my 30s usually. The non-Adderall stims made me have so much anxiety, it was horrible. Adderall is great. And I've used (never recreational for any of this) modafinil. It is great, but since it's only FDA approved for narcolepsy, it's hard to get bc it's EXTREMELY expensive. It is a great drug though, if you can get it. I just happen to have a form of narcolepsy, so I could get it. Maybe if more ppl took (needed) it, the pricing would go down? Idk.

I'm definitely not trying to make you feel bad, hence the parts in my comment about not making assumptions. OP called me out on a comment yesterday bc my words come out offensive at times. Sorry about that...I do not blame you at all, IF YOU IN FACT NEED THEM. I blame shit like this: https://www.aafp.org/news/government-medicine/20180315missouriopioids.html\n\nI'm sorry you have so much suffering, it really sucks & those in power need to go thru the pain all of us combined, then get tortured by not getting any relief. It has taken me some seriously careful planning & manipulation (not of doctors, but of the way I go about slowly navigating the system). I will not quit trying to get ppl who don't need pain meds/opiates/benzos, to fucking stoppit. If I offend someone along the way, I'm sorry. I do not mean to offend you, I'm actually on your side. If they were to cut me off completely tomorrow, I'd lose my shit. I had my doctor move my opiate to one that's a Schedule III vs II. He was fine with it, even though he knew exactly what I was doing. He had started acting stupid at giving me diazepam with 7.5/325 hydrocodone, even though I had been on it years without bad effects, the govt was scaring him about his license (not just him obviously, he just took it really seriously really quickly). Anyway, the Schedule III Rx actually works very well, but really makes my stomach upset, but add in food & Nexium, and it works. You can figure out which one I'm talking about bc I'm not going to mention it here as then ppl will possibly flock to it making the govt notice it & step up it's classification as well. So, I hope you feel better...I wish you luck & wish you find relief. I also wish we didn't have to resort to spending insane amounts of money just to live a semi-pain free life. I'm lucky, for now. So, I'm definitely not trying to act better than you. I'm just trying to get ppl who unnecessarily abuse medication meant for us who need it. \u262e\ufe0f", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwvdmft": [{"0_Comment Submission": "User base growth", "1_Text": "I was wondering if that would be ok to use.
