After relapsing and now being on 8mg suboxone a day, I would *never* try and cramp someone's style if they chose to work steps on sub or done. Like suboxone helps with the cravings so immensely, that sometimes I honestly even forget I'm an addict (only at work when I'm really busy, but still). I'm definitely not sober, cuz I drink, smoke, and even use occasionally (not like I would say I'm \"sober\" even if I was just taking suboxone) but I feel like this is no more than an argument in semantics, and it leads people to not even try cleaning their act up because of it.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dw9u120": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Let's hear those stories", "1_Text": "Be careful man .
