Using the Government to kidnap people and lock them in cages for possessing a plant that grows naturally all over the Earth is what is immoral as fuck. \n And tax money is already used to prescribe people suboxone and methadone and countless medications--why not diacetylmorphine like in other countries?  It has a shorter half-life and less intense withdraws than sub/done.  Why not allow people to grow poppies and marijuana in their yards?   It is already dirt cheap to manufacture compared to other drugs including suboxone--allowing personal growth will make it even cheaper. \n\n Cost is not a reasonable excuse considering what we spend today (TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS $$$$) on a war that is perpetuating street violence and death from dangerous substances like fentanyl and carfent-not to mention destroying the lives of Millions of people that are effectively thrown out of society.   This is not some philosophical question that we as a society have time to debate-we are not starting from baseline here-we are starting from a horrible point in time with the #1 cause of accidental death in the nation (for the first time in history) being legal drug overdose and Millions of non-violent \"offenders\" rotting in cages.  We need legalization and expanded treatment NOW.\n\nI just don't understand how anyone can complain about Government spending money on their own citizens-when our Government spends more money blowing things up and rebuilding them in various nations WE SHOULD NOT BE IN.
