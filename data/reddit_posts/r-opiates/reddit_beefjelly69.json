It's essentially another ~$400 monthly bill that has to be taken care of, and 2) no matter what I said to my counselor or the nurse staff at the clinic, they weren't trying to hear about my desire to expedite the process so I can move on to other things and that I'm not that other guy who comes in and has been on methadone for 20+ years with no intention of stopping.\n\nSo I just thought, \"fuck it, I can do this\"\n\nSide note: I'm also in no way bashing anyone at the methadone clinic I went to here in Fort Worth TX.
