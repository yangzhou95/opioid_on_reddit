I have a similar long, heavy use history as you. I struggle with \u201ccompletely clean\u201d as well. I\u2019ve been clean of opiates and heroin for over 10 months now, off my prescribed benzos for 2. I barely ever drink, I smoke weed, and I consider myself clean. Because I am clean from anything that was ever an issue for me. I\u2019m careful not to ever step into substances I know may set me down a bad path, so yes, in my heart I am my own best definition of clean.\n\nI used kratom to detox, and knew it was a slippery slope so I tapered off.

And I\u2019m like the little Dutch boy (girl whatever) like, everytime I get one hole plugged the water starts spraying out another and I\u2019m running out of hands. Plus self esteem issues from being a junkie for the last 10 years. \n\nOne thing that has helped more than anything is NA/AA - with the whole focus on teaching people to stop trying to control everything. That\u2019s always been an issue. As I realize that I can only actually control a small subset of things in my life, and that worrying about the rest stresses me out. So I\u2019ve gotten a lot of peace from practicing that. Even if you don\u2019t like 12 step you can take something from that.\n\nBut yeah, it\u2019s hard. Being a grown up kind of sucks.

Similar thing happened to me. When I got off dope, I was what I call \u201cskinny fat\u201d - I wasn\u2019t really fat but I was flabby and in awful shape. My mind frame at the time (since I\u2019d been living on cereal, ice cream and sour patch kids) was \u201coh, now I can eat and get healthy!\u201d\n\nBut I didn\u2019t understand what that meant, and thought it meant I could eat everything.
