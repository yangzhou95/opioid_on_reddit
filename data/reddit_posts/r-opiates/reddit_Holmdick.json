Bucket and rotation controls remain the same. (SAE vs ISO). In the industry we usually refer to them as Caterpillar (probably the most common in the U.S.) or John Deere (I believe the most common setup in the rest of the world) controls. Some machines can switch between either set up on the fly electronically or by switching a valve over. Some you can switch by literally unhooking the hoses from the pump and rearranging them \"backwards\" to switch the function from either stick (never done it this way, but I've heard some old boys say it can be done). It's a pain in the ass to switch from one control pattern to the other once you become familiar with one of the setups. Think of it like going between inverted and normal controls on a video game (or something like that). Once you get it ingrained in your muscle memory switching to the opposite control setup can really fuck with you.", "2_Subreddit": "mechanical_gifs"}], "dlq9eu8": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Mechanical Shovel Controls", "1_Text": "It's mostly muscle memory, but to run one of these things in the field requires quite a bit of mental concentration and skill.
