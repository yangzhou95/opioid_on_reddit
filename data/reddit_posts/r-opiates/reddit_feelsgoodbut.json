Its pretty simple just involves crushing all the pills, stirring them in a glass of warm water till they dissolve, putting said glass into the freezer, and then collecting it and straining (with something like a thin towel or ideally a coffee filter) the remaining clear liquid into a glass for your consumption, leaving the thick layer of paracetamol which should be at the very bottom of the glass that you strained.

This is so important, and I'm glad you are self-aware enough to know this and question me on it. I think as users/addicts, we all have had many 'moments' where we vow that we are legitimately done with it all, and we genuinely believe it, only to wake up in a completely different mind state the next morning. \n\n\nI too, have had many similar moments. But none like this. This is the real deal, and to be honest it's like nothing I've ever experienced. Just complete  and utter **certainty** that I am putting this life behind me, and marching forward into sobriety with 100% success. I've been abusing opiates for 3 years (successfully chipped for 5 years before that) and the longest I've gone without using is 11 days. It's quietly been breaking my heart as the repercussions have taken place in my life. But suddenly, a switch has been flicked in my mind. \n\nA big factor for this 'epiphany' if you will, was openly telling my parents for the first time (they knew I was using, they just didnt know what). I always had thought that I will sort it out on my own and don't need to burden them, but the moment I told them I realised that 1. they will keep me accountable, and 2. I now have a support network, which is crucial for recovery. \n\nI understand that I have not actually executed the sobriety yet, and to people looking in on what I'm saying, it may seem like im counting my chickens before they hatch, but nonetheless I am 100% positive that I will not be using again. I feel as though it's already happened.\n\nYes, you're 100% right in saying its only pivottal if I follow through with it, and I'll be following through with everything I've got. Thank you for wishing me luck.\n\n\nPS: Apologies for the mini-essay, I'm enjoying the expressive outlet lol.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwkbzbk": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Everybody has their time.

It's crazy. The past 3 years of my most hardcore usage have gone in the blink of an eye. Time just flies by so fast. \n\n\nAnyways, I'm getting out and I'm getting out now. I'm not crashing this bus.

This is happening and its happening right now.\n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a snoop, I just clicked on your profile and saw a comment you made a day ago. My situation is very much similar. \n\n\nWonderful middle class family. Eventually start dabbling in oxy. Go from snorting large amounts of oxy, to snorting less amounts of H, because efficiency reasons. Strictly snort, could never shoot. Have **no** friends who do the same. For 2-3 years or so I would successfully chip. Originally started leaving 7 days in between usage. Then 3 days in between. Then 2. Then 1. Then 2 days on, 1 day off. So on so forth, you know how the story goes. \n\nI'd mostly use in my room by myself, but sometimes I'd be out with other people and they wouldn't know that I was on opiates. And now it has been at the point where work is a nightmare if I don't rack 2-3 lines in the toilets throughout the day. But that life's all over now. Will be a difficult transition, but it WILL happen.\n\n\nNot 100% where I'm going with this. I guess I'm just highlighting that there is always someone struggling with addiction who has a similar situation to yours. It can happen to anyone. It's all about how you perform and what you do when you say \"enough's enough\". \n\n\nCongratulations on 5 days my man. Keep that firey motivation alight. One day at a time. You can do it.

BUT, if you don't put your \"getting clean\", before EVERYTHING else. Then you will not have everything else. You will have nothing.
