Take one at a time and carefully flip them over and see if the score mark and 30 is also facing the correct direction. If they ALL are also facing the right direction then most likely you have fakes. The 30 should be facing different directions, left side right side or upside down. This isn\u2019t a fool proof way but the real deal have the mbox side pressed and then 30 on the opposite side pressed at different times which changes the directions. A fake one would more then likely be pressed in one pill press and thus have the mbox and 30 facing the same direction on all the pills.\n\nBy just visually looking at these they look real.
