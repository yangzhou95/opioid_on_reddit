I bought them just because they were cheap and I figured I'd never need butane again. I can link it if you want. This is the question though, was the explosion from these cans or was it a gas leak. Yes btw we have a heater with gas and a stove/oven with gas. The only other thing it could have been was these butane cans. And yes, the authorities are looking into it but no arrests or anything of the sort was made. There is no way she would have been making butane hash oil or anything like that if that's what you were thinking. Was she smoking something? I don't know, it's impossible to find out, I wasn't there the fire dept apparently knows nothing and she just can't communicate.
