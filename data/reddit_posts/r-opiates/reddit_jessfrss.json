Oral herpes can be spread sharing drinks and saliva, but I wouldn\u2019t worry about that since oral\nHerpes is cold sores of the mouth and 8/10 people have it. Just wear protection and be careful- a man can pass oral herpes to *your*  genitalia if they go down on you. Or if they have genital herpes and are not even showing symptoms, if you go down on them they can give you genital herpes in your mouth area, confusing I know, but pretty much HSV1(oral) and HSV2(genital) can show in either area. They make a \u201cdental dam\u201d as well to help avoid the spread of saliva/potential blood even since STDs such as HIV Hep spread via blood.
