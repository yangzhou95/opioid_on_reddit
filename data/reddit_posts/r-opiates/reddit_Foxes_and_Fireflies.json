It's really, really easy to go through an entire prescription that fast. If possible, find someone who can ration them out for you.

My advice to you, and what  most pain clinics do, is have one ER for around the clock pain relief and then one IR for breakthrough pain.\n\nIf he offered oxycodone and Oxycontin, I'd take him up on those. He's not going to offer them and tell you to call in if the current relief isn't working, and then when you call in, say \"PSYCHE I was just testing you, NO PAIN RELIEF FOR YOU!\" \n\nRoxicodone is just a name brand Oxycodone, and OxyContin is just name brand extended release oxycodone. If you're on a long-acting pain med like Oxycontin, you won't need to take as much of the instant release, short acting oxycodone when your pain spikes. Dilaudid (hydromorphone) is still prescribed but it's rarer and is used for more severe pain.\n\nI'm not sure that his being from Syria will change the way he prescribes medications.
