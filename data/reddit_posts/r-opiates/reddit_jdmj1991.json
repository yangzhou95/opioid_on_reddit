We met while clean got high tried to get clean over and over and eventually one of us fell. I kept using for a while after that, tried to kill myself, just couldn\u2019t do it. Then one day went away and pulled it together. Idk what changed, I just got really tired. Didn\u2019t want to start up again I suppose. I think about her all the time, what\u2019d she\u2019d be like now, if we\u2019d be together, if we would\u2019ve gone through with the marriage, would I still live up north or down south? Just so many questions I wanna ask her, I reread her love notes, and I look at pictures and videos of us. I miss her so much, she kept me alive in so many dark times. And then I thought, well she would be so pissed if she died and I literally learned nothing, I mean I think she\u2019d understand completely why I used, but it wouldn\u2019t make it any easier for her to accept that I didn\u2019t make any changes. She wanted to change, and I think she would\u2019ve if dope allowed her the time, but that\u2019s the problem with dope you get no fucking time, you\u2019re dead before you are 30, I just turned 28 and I\u2019m only learning now how stupid I was/am/going to be.

The time you\u2019re in now is very challenging and I remember the days that I spent there. For me, it was very confusing. I haven\u2019t thought about this for some time, and to tell you the truth, I haven\u2019t thought about it much since I kicked dope. But I\u2019m happy and nostalgic to be feeling these strong emotions again, because it reminds me how close I was to her. I continued to use after she got died to numb the pain, and then I would feel the pangs of guilt about getting high, especially because in the months preceding my fianc\u00e9\u2019s death, she was trying very hard to get clean. I definitely wasn\u2019t a good influence on her life during this time. I feel so remorseful about this, but what do heroin addicts do, they get high, and so what did everyone expect? This was how I rationalized my shitty behavior, but even then I still felt the guilt. And of course, I know most people feel so guilty when they get high, but this was a different type of guilt. Maybe I wasn\u2019t feeling true guilt before, but I definitely did now. Just this horrible overwhelming sense of dread, and just this feeling that this beautiful girl, that my heart belonged to, lost her life and here I am just continuing down the same road. It was hell, and it lasted several months. However, like so many uncomfortable things that happen to heroin addicts I learned to just live with it, and felt into this rut where I almost used her overdose as a justification to continue using and then one day everything totally collapsed. Housing, job security, and the few remnants of a functional life had finally fallen by the way side. I was sitting at the train station in Boynton Beach, FL. I was sick, I was so tired, and I just didn\u2019t want to get high anymore. Anyways, fast forward and I realized that anything good that I do, or any kindness that I show to others, is her shining through me. I think that because I was a horrible person before, and I\u2019m still pretty shitty, but just getting slightly better, lol. But whoever I am today is because she kept me going and then looked out for me and made sure I was lucky enough to be narcan\u2019d and survive long enough to be able to make a change. I realized I owed her fucking big time, and was I going to flake on my responsibilities or was I going to help her family cope with this shit? Before she died, we were in a pretty bad way obviously, but one of the things that struck me was that this beautiful girl, besides her family and myself, didn\u2019t really have anyone and people quickly moved on as they do when hearing about overdoses these days, and I thought that if I die that is one more little piece of her that dies, and that thought tore me up. Even now, off dope for a year, I have a job and a car, you know a real regular life and I\u2019m still here trying to make sense of losing her. Part of the hard part for me is that some of this is just so senseless, especially my own personal actions. I just know one thing for sure, I will always love her and I guess the rest doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019m so sorry, I wish you didn\u2019t know this pain.
