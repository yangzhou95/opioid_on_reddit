I feel a small percentage of the medical community know how hard it is to come off long term benzo use. With the opioid \"epidemic\" in full force, all focus is on painkillers and heroin.

Even the thought of tapering was overwhelming for me. Going to a detox was one of the hardest and one of the most important things I have ever done. It is VERY HARD to do it yourself. I learned for me personally, you need to change your environment and not be in control. I was so afraid of having a seizure or feeling like shit for months on end. Having medical professionals around you, giving drugs to calm your withdrawal and taper you down so you don't seize is very comforting. I can say that giving up control and actually wanting to get better were the 2 keys for me. If you want it, you can do it.
