This week I went 5 days with only using a few tramadol and 20mg of hydrocodone which is a big step for me considering I usually do 40-60mg of hydrocodone a day. Today I got in a huge fight with my dad and went out and got 5 hydrocodone and took them all :( so mad at myself for blowing my really good week and such awesome progress I was making. I slipped up yesterday by thinking I could just take 2 hydrocodone and be fine (i have actual back problems so it\u2019s easy for me to justify use of a small amount because I\u2019m actually in pain-but I know that I use and abuse pain meds for reasons other than pain relief) after using those 2 yesterday I went out and got 5 today so clearly I cannot control or spread out my use. It\u2019s also easy for us to justify our use because we don\u2019t use an insane amount and compared to others it doesn\u2019t seem too bad, but like you said it\u2019s not even enjoyable anymore. We waste all of our money and time chasing after something that barely makes a difference anymore. Time to give it up! This is just a minor set back and we can keep up the good work!!! 2 steps forward one step back will probably be the case for a while...but we will get there!
