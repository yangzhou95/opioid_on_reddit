First thought was I'm going directly to jail, do not pass go. I was a fucking idiot for not looking around. Luckily it was literally the only cool cop in town who actually gave a shit and didn't want to see me get a charge that would absolutely fuck up my life. He gave me a serious talk and basically said that he had me dead to rights. At the end of it he said that this was the only verbal warning I would ever get and that he wanted to see me make something of myself. We shook hands and he took off. To this day I have never felt that complete rush of multiple feelings.

None of these things would likely have  been possible if I got charged for everything that night. I see your point, but for my personal situation it made a difference in a very possible way.
