I had a similar situation with my Oma after my uncle and cousin died (father son)  from pancreatic cancer 1 1/2 years apart from each other.  She ended up abusing her xanax and I could see it she was running out of her scripts like crazy and just generally out of it.  So I talked to her and she admitted that she was taking more than she was supposed to but she didn't know how to stop. So I offered to move in for a few weeks and get her off of them.  It would make it easier considering she's 88 years old.  So I moved in and we tapered her down pretty quick.  She still takes them but not as often as the bottle even prescribes.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dw7iyxv": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Fent warning - Newark, NJ", "1_Text": "Go to imgur.com create an account and upload it and repost it here.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dw9eh5g": [{"0_Comment Submission": "getting broken up with and blocked", "1_Text": "If this is the case good riddens!!!
