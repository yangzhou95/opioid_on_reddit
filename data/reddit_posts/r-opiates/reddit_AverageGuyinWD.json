I've tried taking like 1000mg tramadol at once trying to get some kind of high but it just is not going to happen, ESPECIALLY WITH A FENT TOLERANCE!, and now i look back at how stupid I was and how i'm super lucky I didn't die from a seizure, as Tramadol seriously will cause seizures. I found that going from Fent/good BTH into withdrawls, I can take 350mg tramadol and all my withdrawals will go away. Tramadol also has some crazy anti-depressant properties which I was surprised to learn after taking 350mg for a few days. Definitely save the Tramadol for when your in bad withdrawals, it will make you well, but its just not going to get you high, and taking more and more wont help, and actually might kill you or cause permanent damage from seizure.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwu075q": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Would you have switched to heroin if oxys were still everywhere?", "1_Text": "Well i think the first question is, what was the opiate situation like BEFORE the OC80's and Oxy30's started being so easily available suddenly. I literally knew NOT ONE PERSON who was addicted to opiates. It was the flood of those (at first) relatively cheap pills that got the whole epidemic started. The maker of OC80 got fined 600million by the FDA for false advertising these pills as \"less addictive\" than other opiates and \"sustained release\" which was just completely obviously false to anyone who got high off these pills. The fact that they only got fined only $600m when they made 20+BILLION in profit just of OC shows you how corrupt the FDA is. But yes, after everyone was addicted to easy to get cheap oxy, like my whole school was addicted to oxy in high school, then they switched to the \"OP version\" of OC80 and the price of an \"original oc80\" went from $40 to $80 like overnight. Within a couple months, black tar heroin from mexico started flooding the streets and basically 100% of everyone addicted to oxy switched to \"brown\"/Black tar or \"PURE\" as it was called at first, as opposed to \"gunpowder\"/weak heroin. Only the rich kids or those who went into crime/drug dealing themselves stayed able to sustain their expensive oxy habit. I'm pretty sure NOBODY wanted to switch to black tar at first, and yes i know a lot of people who quit opiates once their only sustainable option was to switch to heroin. But for anyone who got decent mexican black tar heroin for a decent price, and you smoked it for the first time you realized this stuff is really strong and my \"price per dose\" is going to way cheaper than oxy. Of course then you do it all the time, then tolerance builds up, then a lot of people switched to injecting so they can feel the high more, then the tolerance builds more and now you hear about fent. You try fent and realize that the \"price per dose\" of fent is only like $1 to get high, as opposed to like $10 per dose with black tar, and so you have now arrived at the present situation in the USA. I'm currently of the opinion that there is no easy fix to this because millions of regular people are now addicted to opiates, and dont really care if they are more dangerous, they need opiates now just to feel normal and function in society. I think making oxy and heroin harder to get and therefore more expensive will only lead to an increase in fentanyl use, and that is obviously exactly what is happening right now. So the govt says they want to give fent dealers the death penalty, i guaruntee that is not going to do a damn thing to help the situation. I think the answer is making safer/weaker opiates CHEAP or FREE to currently addicted users so that there is no incentive to switch to the cheaper and more dangerous fentanyl. This is what has proven to work in Switzerland and England, giving people prescription of pure heroin for free (who are already addicted and cant stop). Obviously though we have basically created a giant problem that like keeps getting worse. And I think you need to look at the history of the Chinese governments programs in the past to get their population off opium to see any kind of similar situation with which to compare the USA/Canada's current situation (millions of 20-30 somethings addicted to heroin/fentanyl) which makes the supply of opiates much more easily obtainable for kids. So like now you see some high schools where 80% of the boys in 9th grade are smoking or shooting black tar in some towns. I have to say that \"the mexicans\" can be blamed to some extant, but they were just responding to a new market demand, and then the production exploded, and price went down, availablity went up and now the next generation is going to go through the whole same situation but instead of starting on OXY they go straight to heroin/fent. I think our \"free country/democracies\" here in north america are going to be dealing with a very specific opiate plague that will not affect similar countries in western europe. As far as i'm aware this opiate crisis is only considered a crisis in two countries Canada and USA (with the added drug war in Mexico combining for a giant disaster). I don't think our societies are as strong as in Europe and this could be like a plague that effects the next generation and the next generation until theres some drastic action taken similar to how the Chinese forced their people to get off opium. Will wait and see. I think the makers of suboxone are going to be making tens of billions, and treatment centers are going to be only successful businesses in alot of small towns. Having such a high percentage of the population addicted to powerful opiates is indeed a crisis. WHAT IS THE ANSWER?

Opiate withdrawals are basically the only reason we are all here. That and the fact that opiates when you are using them making you feel great (well at least for a while). Just imagine the worst flu combined with an anxiety attack, where you cant eat or sleep and time moves so slow you literally just want to die. That is what happens once you become dependent. You may think you can manage it, that you are really smart and have strong self control. I am telling you opiates are much stronger, and it will basically ruin your life because then it's not about feeling good or getting high, your taking the drug just to feel normal. And that process can happen extremely fast, literally use OC80 or heroin for 3-4 days in a row and its gonna be your first taste of real hell.
