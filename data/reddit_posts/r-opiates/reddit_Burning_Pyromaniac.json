I had to use this site as I was having problems with my adblockers back then. Im not tech savvy so bear with me here... Everyrhing that is on PW is copied identiacly on this site but without all the reviews, comments and adverts etc.\nI tried it earlier and at first it wasnt fuctioning correctly and kept stating \"... PW must be down please be patient...\" however in the end I got it working but only with the Openload links which was fine for me. \nIDK if this means PW is now back up but I'll check when I finish work and share the url if anyone is interested.", "2_Subreddit": "Piracy"}], "dwrcr05": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Is anyone experiencing weird redirects with Primewire?", "1_Text": "BTW I'd use this site in conjuction with PW side by side so Id use PW to read sypnosis and reviews and then open up the other site to watch it.", "2_Subreddit": "Piracy"}], "dwrwonk": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I know what my problem is-- I want to use heroin forever.", "1_Text": "I havent been ready to quit in all the 20+years whilst using and I doubt I ever will be. I dont want sympathy. I dont want anyone feeling sorry for me. Why do I have to quit? Whats wrong with living the rest of my life using? I will not quit just bc thats what is expected from me. If I choose to in the future then I will do. But for now and the near future I will not be quitting and I will continue to be happy with my life. It might be true for many people that their life will drastically improve once they are clean, but to me its all relative. Yes I have gone through some serious epic shit in my life however even though I'm a junkie, a lifelong junkie, it does not mean I will be constantly hitting rock bottom for the rest of my life. \n\n\nFor the past 6-7 years (coincidentaly its the same timeline of when I last served any prison time) I have actively avoided being involved with negative junkie stigmas that we face everyday but now I dont need to keep trying to avoid it because I naturally avoid it now without any effort. I am happy with my current life and my life will not improve just because I no longer use opiates. I may change my whole outlook next month, I may even be clean \nin 2 years, I may sign in to rehab in the year 2022. Who knows? But it really annoys me hearing people say things like \"I feel sorry for you, you are only existing, your life must be crap etc etc\" Well no darling, just, no.\n\n\nThank you @OP for sharing. I feel you with my heart and I can empathise with everything you say. Kudos for your beautiful post, I wish I could have worded it as eleqantly as you have. Our lives should not be depicted, discriminated and judged by how long we have been clean for, when we will get clean and preparing ourselves to face the detox for when we 'feel' ready to get clean.  I wish you the best throughout your future life as an addict  or not as an addict, but for being YOU.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwv3aor": [{"0_Comment Submission": "My house is fully protected!", "1_Text": "Next you will tell me hes been dead for decades so why am I so special for Bruce Lee to come visit my house to pretend pose with fake nunchuks?\nAlso you forgot to mention his legs are missing ... or did he float out of his coffin? \n\nLighten up dude!", "2_Subreddit": "funny"}]}], "1_submissions": [{"8a14ut": [{"0_Title": "My house is fully protected!", "1_Text": "From around 8pm GMT UK last night I could use the site as normal but every streaming link would open an advert like \"WATCH IN HD!\" and \"STREAM INSTANTLY\" types. \nI thought this one a problem with my adblockers and pop-upblockers and I removed these chrome extensions and installed new ones several times.\nLogging in would give me this message \"LOGIN IS DISABLED ON THIS PROXY-RETURN TO HOME PAGE\" which no idea what this meant so I installed Firefox and Opera.\nI continually kept trying until 12am without any success.
