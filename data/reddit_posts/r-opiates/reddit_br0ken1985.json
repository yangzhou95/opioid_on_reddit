Some people think it's the devil but for lots of people, it can be a life saver. Just never forget that it is still a strong, addictive opiod but can give you a MUCH more stable life where you can work on your underlying issues in the meantime. Then slowly taper off of It, when ready. If you read a horror story, i'd bet nearly all of them involve someone who tapered off too fast and/or jumped too high. Everyone I know who tapered slowly said they had very mild, if any, wd symptoms. Since methadone is a full agonist, it helped me infinitely more than Subs ever could. The data behind MAT show it has, by far, the highest success rate of any firm of treatment but for some reason has a horrible stigma, even among us drug users.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwuzbqf": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How many of you succeeded at staying clean after being forced into a rehab?", "1_Text": "I commented my suggestion for looking into methadone as well.

Nothing wrong with assuming so and being safe than to think you know everything. I used H several times but the last time was before you started hearing about people cutting it all with fent. \n\nI thought the same thing.

Just need a few specs per stamp or w/e to do the job. Another bad thing about this is yes, it would increase the amount of inactive cut in a bag since you don't need as much active ingredient. It also increases the chances of hot spots since you're talking about literal specks the size of grains of salt. Can be very hard to accurately mix that up where one stamp doesn't have 5 grains worth and another has 2. I've definitely seen and heard of people selling stuff as just fent, but in most cases, it was not pure fent because . 5g of pure fent could be quite a bit. \n\nI think most people still pay the same price but I think that's more because of dealers selling it as dope, not fent-laced dope. Some do it on purpose while some truly don't know it has fent in it if it's cut with fent before they get it. Thankfully, I've read that more and more people are adding dye to their fent to make it obvious when you get dope cut with fent because it will have bits of some wild ass color in it. And I guess some people are intimidated by the whole DNM thing while others feel they don't have the knowledge needed to do so (even though it's fairly simple once you get the first order out of the way). People are scared of getting ripped off, busted, etc. Plus us addicts aren't known for being the most patient of people so they'd rather go get something that is an immediate, for sure thing instead of ordering via a DNM then waiting days for it to arrive.\n\nOf course some BTH is cut with fent and I'm sure how often is and will continue to rise but it is much less common than in ECP. Where i live, you can get both but ECP is much more common than BTH. \n\nIf you have any other questions or want/need any clarification on anything I said, feel free to ask.
