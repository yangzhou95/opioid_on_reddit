We are good at looking for sympathy, or I had it worse than you, especially if they aren't a addict. So we act like we normally wouldn't, or disclose SHIT we shouldn't, we feed the fire! Most of the time we are the fire! Ya people play a part, but only off we let them in our circle, or into our world! Once that happens it is a wrap! I lost my job months before that, I gave away it. And I gave away my kryptonite, all unknowingly, I learned something normal people realize right away. Don't trust people we don't really know, and keep,your SHIT, your. SHIT.

Then after that, a couple huge company's realize these guys buzzing over this SHIT and proof, You have a 79 pickup, with this magical fairy SHIT spread on a A8 magnet. I am almost positive being in a similar situation, in my life, that well known guy from 79 didnt give a flying fxck about a magnet, when he is taping his pedals to a.piece of wood fer gigs and scrounging for a six pack of Shlitz and maybe, just maybe a bologna sandwich.
