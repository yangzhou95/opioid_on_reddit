My disagreement is with the lumping in of medication with heroin, and junkies aren\u2019t the ones doing that. This is why my medication has been nearly cut off \u2014 because the DEA want more power, and it is getting that power by making Americans think that people who take opioids (prescribed, necessary, often life-saving medication) are all worthless drug addicts who should just stop taking their medication. The people dying are heroin users who are victims of fentanyl substitution, and pain patients forced to get their medication (now with added fentanyl!) from dealers because the health care system cut them off.\n\nFurther, the U.S. is re-criminalizing its approach to drug addiction (heroin, Valium, oxycodone, whatever).

Hydroplaning SUV right into center median.", "1_Text": "Remember this formula: 9 x SQRT {tire pressure} \n\nThis formula works for any vehicle size \u2014 I learned it in flight school. An aerobatic instructor I knew at the time (the guy I ended up marrying the first time) was an airline pilot. When you\u2019re flying a 777 or other passenger or cargo jet, it\u2019s really important not to hydroplane while landing.\n\nYour tires will hydroplane at about 9 x the square root of your tire pressure. Even for the math-deficient driver, it\u2019s not hard to figure out. If your rear tires have 36 psi, you will hydroplane at 54 mph. (The square root of 36 is 6. Six times nine is 54. Ta-da!)\n\nYes, some factors will change this equation, in reality (tire tread/composition, road surface, etc.). That\u2019s why it\u2019s a *general* rule.\n\nIt\u2019s not exact, but it\u2019s close enough. If you want to be extra-careful, knock a couple of mph off. (Always err on the slower side.)\n\nIf you end up hydroplaning anyway, take your foot off the gas and keep the tires pointed in the direction of travel.
