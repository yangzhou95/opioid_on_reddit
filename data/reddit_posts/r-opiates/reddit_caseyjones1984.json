My first love was OC 80's. Then came Opana and Dilaudid, for me at least. I've never enjoyed h near as much as I did  pharms. I also considered it dirty and unpredictable. Although, I am located in the middle of the map, Ks/Mo, where we are for some reason unable to get ECP. When I went to New York for rehab, which I graduated successfully, I then went to NYC and immediately copped the best h and coke I ever even knew existed and got stuck there until my family had to come track me down. Granted the price difference was insane : sleeve= $300 vs. 1 gram of shitty tar for $160. So I guess it is also very dependent upon location as well.  For me, with the options I have at hand, I would've stayed all day with pharms, given the price gouge never was a thing and the availability for the good OC's never became nonexistent.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}]}], "1_submissions": [{}]}]}
