Honestly, continuing to do drugs when you have children is selfish, but it speaks to how powerful the disease of addiction is, especially when it comes to opiates.

And in my opinion , Ibogaine treatment needs to be researched far more, and as admirable as you intentions may be, you lack to resources to do so. \n\nIf you want to make a difference in this community and help stem the opioid epidemic, you would be better off supporting prevention, decriminalization (which you mentioned and I commend you for), harm reduction, availability of services, and accessibility of affordable health care. \n\nThink about it. Even if by some divine miracle Ibogaine became legal tomorrow...who could afford it? Not the people here who are struggling to finance their habits on a daily basis. Pharmaceuticals are most expensive when first released. Take Hepatitis C medications for example...sofosbuvir (sovaldi) treatment when first released to the public cost upwards of 1000 dollars a day! \n\nI admire what you are trying to do, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible . I think there are several other far more viable treatment options to pursue making more widely available that would benefit those addicted to opioids.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwu6l1m": [{"0_Comment Submission": "The poorer, the fatter: Obesity is not randomly distributed across the U.S. It is linked to demographics, community characteristics, income inequality, and race, 500-city analysis shows.", "1_Text": "I wouldn\u2019t classify beans in a tortilla as healthy at all.

We understand nutrition labels and the importance of balanced meals. \n\nI see the drive ways being slammed all day every day, and I have done the math.

I do understand where you are coming from. I was an IV heroin user for many years. I was on methadone for three years, and subutex for two after that. It\u2019s a lengthy process for sure, but it did save my life. \n\nI do have to say honestly my opinion may be slightly affected by the fact that Ibogaine scares the shit out of me. Hardcore psychedelics like that just scare me. I\u2019ve had a terrible acid trip, and that happened whilst knowing that LSD would not kill me. I can\u2019t imagine how anxious I would be on a drug that could be deadly. \n\nI think Ibogaine has its place, but I think it needs to be researched more. Unfortunately in this country, the FDA, doctors, and big Pharma are a nasty trifecta, with the end goal being financial gain as opposed to the well being of our citizens. \n\nAt least if it were legal, people could take it in a controlled setting where they have access to immediate health care should it be necessary. And in the end I suppose even a 1 in 300 fatality rate is better than the fatality rate of addicts who cannot break their cycle of addiction. I did watch a documentary not too long ago, in which a doctor (in the US) was approved to do a small study on Ibogaine. Maybe if more doctors push for this, it will gain some traction.
