I'm not religious, was atheist for a long time, but I've been working on my spiritual life and I have found a higher power that works for me. There's a quote by Soren Kirkegaard, \"The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.\" That helps me when I feel like an idiot for praying. It actually does help me feel grounded.\n\nNot a big book thumper, but going to some meetings helps when I get self conscious and weird mentally.\n\nSober living seemed to be a huge factor in keeping me clean at first. Good accountability.\n\nSurrounding myself with people that really want this is important too.
