Where do mixer fees go?", "1_Text": "TL;dR: coin mixing is no longer safe, it is a waste of crypto, use monero\n\nBitcoin was never designed to be anonymous. The addresses of all transactions are recorded in the ledger. \n\nLet's say Uncle Internetguy wants to order some primo LSD or BTH off the darknet. If I purchase Bitcoin then chances are (because it's the easiest way) I will use something like coin base to turn my national currency into Bitcoin. Well most governments require some sort of ID to purchase BTC through a vendor, they also need a bitcoin wallet to send it to. \n\nI order the good and get them; hooray! Now let's say the vendor got busted and they looked through his clients. Through the power of block chain analysis algorithms they are able to link the address that sent the vendor btc to all of the addresses that were used to \"tumble\" the coin, which started with my credit card linked account on coin base. While this creates deniability it does not prevent LE from coming and knocking on the door of the first person to procure the coin.\n\nThese algorithms were at one point thought to be impracticle for reasons such as: the length of the block chain, the independence of accounts(maybe I paid someone to move a couch and he used my old btc to buy drugs, and the fact that there is vastly high ceiling on the number of wallets that can be created. \n\nOur brightest minds in the NSA, CIA, and academics realized that most people only tumbled once or twice before sending to a wallet they would use for illegal activity. They also noticed that the amounts we're almost always the same with a deviation of common mixing fees (they are proportional to the amount of coin being mixed). This and the slow verification rate of the block chain (think how long it takes to get BTC, or rather how long it took in last December) led some people to creating efficient algorithms that can make a mapping of the accounts that transfer crypto to one another. It may not be \ud83d\udcaf% effective at solving the crime but these algs can make a clear link between hundreds of accounts just by walking through the BTC ledger and recording the accounts as they are created. If they have a target address then it's even easier to track.\n\nThere are multiple \"secure/private\" currencies but the most practical, stable, and widely accepted is Monero(XMR). It uses ring structures in combination with an RSA like algorithm to keep the sender and receiver isolated from one another. This creates many extra steps in tracking transaction history. There are many problems with monero such as a poorly designed GUI and less support that btc. Some people believe that mixing monero is effective but this is a tricky problem. The factors of the ring can be determined from the end of each block in the block chain.\n\nAlways try to buy cryto with cash and secure messaging. \n\n\nThis being said a little headache setting everything up is worth your freedom the only way to never get caught by the law is to never break the law.", "2_Subreddit": "DarkNetMarketsNoobs"}], "dwihko5": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Gamers of Reddit, What video game made you emotional?", "1_Text": "The death of Brooklyn in CoD: Big Red 1", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dwinr0b": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Good Vibes", "1_Text": "I've actually been off the oxy for a minute so 5 has me nodding stupid hard.
