You should really focus on getting the dexterity to press jump as fast as you can after your shine, I believe the fastest you can cancel it is 3 or 4 frames. The window to jump out of shine is large, so make sure you're not wasting precious hitstun by sitting in your shine too long. The way I got good was doing a shine->short hop over and over until it was easy.", "2_Subreddit": "SSBM"}], "dcfrmjc": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Daily Discussion Thread 01/14/17", "1_Text": "what character do you play? I personally had some extreme frustration issues when I was playing samus and doctor mario. I had to relearn the entire game when I switched to fox, which was part of what removed the emotional aspect of the game for me. I lost constantly in the beginning, so I was just like, fuck it, who cares anymore. I just learned from the ground up.\n\nNot saying that you should switch to fox necessarily, but I do see a great opportunity here if you decide to completely learn to use x or y for jump. All you have to do is go into it with the expectation that you will lose every single game, and then bam, no more frustration. Hope to hear back from you.", "2_Subreddit": "SSBM"}], "dcfuy0y": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How important is it to have only 1 main when starting", "1_Text": "When I switched around characters a lot as a beginner, doing that definitely kept me a beginner for way longer than was possibly necessary. It kept me from getting to the next level. When I first started maining fox I began to improve rapidly. whenever I switched off of him I actually got worse and fell back into old habits rapidly. After a year of maining fox my skills are a bit more set in stone, but if I switch to falcon or falco, my improvement is completely halted until I switch back to fox. Overall, being a solo a solo fox main has been a huge buff to my skills at every point of my development.", "2_Subreddit": "SSBM"}], "dcfwd7e": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Daily Discussion Thread 01/14/17", "1_Text": "I guess I forgot the most important thing, which is stick to only one character. I had a lot of trouble improving until I only played fox and didn't switch at all, even for one game. Dedicating myself to only fox was the one thing that allowed me to break through to the next level. When you are losing badly and it seems like everything you're doing has stopped working, that is the key point that you want to stick it out with your character. It will force you to create new strategies that counter the things that countered the things you were doing originally.
