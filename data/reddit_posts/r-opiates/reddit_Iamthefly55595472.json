They want all new opioid agonists to be automatically scheduled until fda approval. There's just no way to reasonably do that. Yeah you can probably find a way to ban new fentalogues, but kratom is so far removed from that. For kratom to apply under a law like that would require them to ban basically anything that works as an opioid receptor agonist. \n\nSo yeah, I would not worry at all about a bill like this, and focus our efforts on specific bills to ban kratom.", "2_Subreddit": "kratom"}], "dw6iiqj": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Anyone in here a fan of The Office?", "1_Text": "Creed Bratton is the best character.
