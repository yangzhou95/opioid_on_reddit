With that knowledge,  I guess unless you know 100% you are getting pharm legit pills. Why not just do heroin if being sick stresses you out this much? Is it like a red line in your mind that you told yourself you would never cross?

I guess I just jumped head first into heroin ( I wasn't someone who did pills and then couldn't get them, I just did H first. .lol) \n\nIt sounded like you are getting real pills too if you know the girl & her dad. I guess my point was if you are going to start venturing out and getting pills from other sources be prepared to get pressed pills, and if you are willing to take a chance on pressed pills you could find dope a fuck of alot faster and cheaper.
