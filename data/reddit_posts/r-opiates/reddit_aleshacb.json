It was always a question/feeling in the back of my mind but I never wanted to believe it. I knew he had some issues w pills in the past before I met him and anytime the topic of heroin would come up, he'd never fail to reassure me that he's never done it. Maybe once.. but it was before we met.\nIt got to the point where his actions were so obvious of him using that I had to take things into my own hands and investigate. There had been countless times of me asking if he had been using recently or currently, but of course he denied it. It was one night that we were cleaning our apartment and he was grabbing a blanket behind the couch and he passed out leaning over the couch....lol. I just stood there behind him, waiting for him to wake up, and ended up having to wake him up. I asked him wtf was up and what do ya know, his response was \"I'm just really tired\" haha yeah, okkkkk. It ended up being that night that I went through his wallet (his really old wallet that wasn't his current one mind you) that I noticed him carrying around recently, which also was glued to him that night, and I found the boy. I know it was wrong of me to go through his things, but I know any gf would have done the same if she were in my situation.\n\nOkay so super long story short (sorry for the novel haha didn't expect to get all into it), it deffffffinitey sounds like he's using. If you haven't confronted him already, I would do it now. But be sure to go into it with a very caring mindset and even though you might feel very angry/betrayed in some way, just reassure him that you just really care and love him and are just concerned (that's if you do feel that way, idk you're relationship at all but I assume that you do have those feelings).\n\nIf you have any questions or if I could help you in any sort of way, please PM me!
