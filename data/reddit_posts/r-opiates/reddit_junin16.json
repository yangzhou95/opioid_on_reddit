I'm giving the worst cenario so you can see my point. In my mind prison should be to lock people that are a danger to society, if the guy that commited the crime did something that doesn't mark him for life, like shoplifting, drug dealing without killing anyone etc then maybe he can go to a different place and be rehabilitated. But what about the people that commited crimes such as the one on this thread? Even if the guy was rehabilitated and sent back to society, would you be ok in living with people like that? Would you let your kids play with him, introduce your wife to him etc? Probably not.
