Most homeless people I know in the UK (I know many) usually wake up with no dope. No drugs, and if their lucky. They've made enough for a morning hit to get well. If not, a lot of times they panhandle or whatever. And stay sick until they make enough money for one hit. This isn't a quick process for most people, you might not even make enough for one hit.\n\nThen the cycle continues. You need another hit later in the day, so you go out to make more money.  \nThis is life for most addicted homeless people, honestly a life nobody deserves.

Previously, there was little reason to focus on RGMA systems in developing opioid dependence treatments. Now there is,\" senior author Joel Gelernter, MD, professor of psychiatry and director of the Division of Human Genetics in Psychiatry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, told Medscape Medical News.\n\nThe study was published online January 11 in Biological Psychiatry.\n\nPromising Lead\nOpioid dependence is a genetically complex disorder that is influenced by complex environmental factors, making it tough to identify genetic factors that underlie the disorder, Gelernter and colleagues note in their article.\n\nTo tease out some of the genetic contributions to opioid dependence, they scanned the genomes of 3058 opioid-exposed European Americans, including 1290 who met DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence.\n\nThey found that the rs12442183 variant near the RGMA gene had a \"robust\" association with opioid dependence. \"If you have a certain RGMA variant, you're more likely to have opioid dependence symptoms than if you have the alternative form,\" Gelernter said.\n\n\"We believe this is a good new lead and hope it encourages novel pharmacological approaches to treating opioid dependence,\" Gelernter told Medscape Medical News. He added that larger opioid dependence clinical samples are needed to replicate and extend the current findings.\n\nThis RGMA variant was also linked to opioid dependence in a group of African Americans, but the association was much weaker than in European Americans.\n\nPrior studies have shown that the protein product of RGMA regulates cell death and nerve growth in the brain, findings that suggest how the gene might alter the brain's response to opioids, the researchers point out.\n\nIn an analysis of brain tissue expression datasets, they further demonstrated a significant correlation between the expression of RGMA and the expression of four genes that have been shown to affect risk for other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and autism.\n\n\"These RGMA coexpressed genes are critical to normal brain function, supporting the potential involvement of RGMA in related biological processes,\" the researchers conclude.\n\n\"In the midst of an opioid crisis, it is timely to identify new genetic risk factors that contribute to addiction risk,\" John Krystal, MD, chairman, Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, and editor of Biological Psychiatry, commented in a news release.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dv7c1sw": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Homeless Wisdom", "1_Text": "Not in my experience, and I've worked and volunteered in multiple different community /addiction centres in multiple cities here in the UK.\nI mean it's just basic logic, where do  you expect these homeless people to get money for drugs? From the \u00a340 they get per week? No, they need a lot more than that. They turn to crime or begging.

In withdraw, we'd give them so food, comfort them and stuff.  Most of them wouldn't take subutex they knew that whenever they managed to get dope, they wouldn't be able to get high if they took that.\n\nWould also go outside and deliver care packages to the many homeless people around the city.
