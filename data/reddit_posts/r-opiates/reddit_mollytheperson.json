I've actually found that throughout the past couple of days, microdosing MDMA has helped me with energy and improved my depression symptoms throughout the day (but not really with focus), but the only weird part is feeling that uncomfortable \"onset of a roll\" feeling for like 10 minutes about a half hour after I first dose. (I've been taking like half of the capsules it came in). instead of relieving anxiety that feeling has literally made me so anxious I've had to like stay in bed until it's over, then when it goes away it feels almost exactly like I've taken a therapeutic dose of Lexapro for the whole rest of the day and I just feel normal and not as depressed. super weird but yeah there def is a correlation there", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "drbg158": [{"0_Comment Submission": "if small doses of MDMA improve my social anxiety, does this mean I'm autistic?", "1_Text": "you're right. it was only for a few days, but yeah here i am, still kickin'", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "drtt5f2": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Ladders and the last of my 80mg of Adderall (=", "1_Text": "how in tf do you get 80mg in one pill", "2_Subreddit": "drugsarebeautiful"}], "dsn5cf9": [{"0_Comment Submission": "going to sound crazy but i have a theory", "1_Text": "woah", "2_Subreddit": "LSD"}], "dsn67ft": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What is the greatest realization you've had while on acid?", "1_Text": "we are all on our own individual trips but we are all on the same big trip at the same time", "2_Subreddit": "LSD"}], "duvidan": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Problems with closing cabinets", "1_Text": "dude this is the truest shit i've read on here. forget all the people posting about not being able to focus in grad school lectures like la-di-da you fancy fuck so what, it's hard to even go about your daily life when someone's always yelling at you about the way you leave shit open or forget to do the most basic of household tasks like a civilized human.", "2_Subreddit": "ADHD"}], "dvipq86": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What do \u2018normal\u2019 people actually do with their time?", "1_Text": "i feel like most normal ppl l8ly are just stoners and constantly listen to like future or something just blown out their minds but can't access their full intellectual ability idk", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "dvipujw": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Do certain songs ever bring you back to one of your acid trips?

( as risky as that sounds i really do do extensive research and try to be responsible bc i am a nerd) I don't think my tendency to think this way will ever really go away \n(oh and i would TRY to learn everything about my obsessive phases growing up but would always get distracted and just conclude with something like \"oh this is weird i'm gonna like this thing and talk people's ears off about the IDEA of the thing even though i'm not really knowledgeable\") (this recently happened to me at work, some guys were talking about the value of bitcoin and investing and different altcoins and even though i don't really know anything except how to buy it, i was like \"omg bitcoins\" but kind of to get a reaction out of them because once again introverted/bored phase of my life and i wanted to see if there'd be a sexist reaction like \"why does this GIRL know about COMPUTERS\" ((i'm the only girl at my job))\nidk what's with this  inner need I have to troll people and make them think i'm \"weirder\" than i actually probably am. just boredom i guess", "2_Subreddit": "ADHD"}], "dwpu7bm": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Found this in my children (17 yo) room.. help identify", "1_Text": "looks like ecstasy", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwwfr6l": [{"0_Comment Submission": "High IQ linked to higher risk of psychological disorders Depression, Anxiety, ADHD & Autism (ASD)", "1_Text": "having an abnormally high IQ is graduating from high school with an IB diploma yet still being 23 without an actual bachelor's because of depression/anxiety", "2_Subreddit": "worldnews"}], "dwwfu1v": [{"0_Comment Submission": "did meth and hated it", "1_Text": "lol i'm not that stupid to  develop an addiction. i mean thanks tho", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}]}], "1_submissions": [{"3h2h6o": [{"0_Title": "Lexapro and DMT", "1_Text": "I eventually like..confessed it to him and  now we're really good friends so it's whatever, lol", "2_Subreddit": "Drugs"}], "3n773s": [{"0_Title": "pupils/reminiscing on an enlightening time in feb.", "1_Text": "I eventually like..confessed it to him and  now we're really good friends so it's whatever, lol", "2_Subreddit": "LSD"}], "3pfb73": [{"0_Title": "anyone have this type of sleep/dream phenomena?
