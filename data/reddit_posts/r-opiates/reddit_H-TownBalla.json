I was introduced to H by a friend who downplayed how addictive it really is, and assured me it was absolutely no different than the 30 mg blue roxy that I would take once every couple of weeks when working on an especially busy night bartending.  Well, needless to say I got addicted pretty fuckin quick and my life spiraled out of control as it tends to when shit starts consuming your entire life.  Anyway, when I got sober I finally came to the realization that it isn't anyone's fault but my own that I got into that situation.  I think it was better for me anyway to recognize what everyone's contribution to the events were, not who is solely responsible.  Because in my opinion there just aren't that many things in life that are that simple.  Just my opinion though.  I've been in your shoes too and it won't help you to look back and wonder what if?

Leaving to go to \"work\" then coming home saying they didnt need him is just another way of saying I needed enough time to go and probably wait for the dope man for a good bit and then come home high with a bag in his pocket.  Tell him to take a drug test, and let him know you support him no matter what.  Just explain that he cant stay with you if hes not doing everything in his power to seek therapy and help to get clean.  He probably will play dumb and get mad.  He may even say some really hurtful shit, but just know hes just lost to this addiction and it isnt really him talking. \n\nIts a tough situation for everybody, but you need to handle it now before any of your fears become reality.  Ive been there and if he isnt seeking help, getting therapy, and involving you both in his plans then he is not only not going to work towards moving out, but at this point he cant even look a week or a month down the road because it just takes over your thought process and all you can ever see is how to get well and then how to hustle to get more.  Its a vicious cycle, but theres hope if you guys can start a dialogue today/tomorrow about the facts of his addiction and where to go next.  \n\nJust my opinion and I dont mean to offend if I did.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dtecrz7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Well fuck Walmart", "1_Text": "Looks like the name brand immodium on the right is still unprotected.

Let me get your jacket man (A brand new 150 dollar North Face that I had literally just bought that day!)

This particular stereotype is just a FACT! Black people are the absolute worst restaurant patrons out of any race.

I am not generalizing, but rather I am using evidence backed personal research to make a point that we as a people are just awful tippers!  It is inexcusable, and it needs to change.  The sense of entitlement is a root cause, as well as the lack of education about what is appropriate behavior when going out to eat, but the main cause in my opinion is that there is this idea in our community that we are sticking it to the man by doing things like this when in reality we are just screwing over hard working individuals who deserve better.
