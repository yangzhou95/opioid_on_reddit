I met my wife and had a happy sober three years. We split up for a few months and I was in a sadness I\u2019d never known. I decided to try heroin. I had always been afraid of heroin and rightfully so. Shot up that first time and that was it for me. Six months later of a gram a day use and I\u2019m five days clean.
