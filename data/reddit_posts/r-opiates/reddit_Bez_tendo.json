I used to love kratom in my early 20s in south Fla they had kava bars everywhere, few of which served kratom leaf or extracts. I loved this extract they branded \"full spectrum\". I was literally about to leave Florida get back up to my home state and get back on the cheap and 7/10 heron I had the access to way back when, ASAP. Buddy told me \"just try this\". After 30 minutes we were at the beach in del rey talking up some beautiful women and I literally said \"I love Florida!\" (Before I found the smurf village at 8-10 bucks a pop at the time). But a couple people who were also having a tough time and trying to leave and told them \"try this\". At first they seemed all good and were like \"what is this sorcery?!\".. until they started puking and began to feel awful. One of them even tried it multiple times but in the end \"it wasnt for them\" but anything else that stimulated opioid receptors they absolutely loved. Just kratom didnt agree with them.

Most gotten was 11 folds in a cinnabun but that was within my heyday of 06-10 until they got knocked.

Tested positive for morphine not thc lol. Thought it was kind of funny. Was sure Id go down for the thc not morph. It all depends on metabolism, do you move a lot or lay around/sit a lot, water intake plays a role in diluting the urine and at first can help remove some as most opiates metabolites are expelled via urine and are soluble in water so more water the better. Also less sugar intake the better, forgot where I read that but allegedly plays a role. As well as potency, amount used and for how long.

From extremely potent and clean diamorph I tested pos from a UA 6-7 days later, used once an evening for 5 nights straight and also hit the bowl twice per night.

Your metabolism, are you active in your daily routine or do you lay/sit around, your frequency of usage and amounts, water intake, sugar intake (read that somewhere and some ppl swear to it, no excessive sugars). Ive had it out in 48-72 hours but also got caught up 6 days later so it varies. Drink water, cut back on the sodas and sugary beverages. Keep the blood flowing.
