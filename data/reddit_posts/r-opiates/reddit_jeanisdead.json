More weight in my ass and thighs, less on my midsection. As someone who is sort of apple sort of hourglass shaped, it has helped my self esteem tons. You do have to fucking eat if you want it, though, which I get is terrifying for the lot of us. But as someone who is primarily bulimic? I made the tough decision to keep some binges down.
