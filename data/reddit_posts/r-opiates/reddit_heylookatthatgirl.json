Definitely do residential treatment to get sober and learn how to be sober for more than 30 days.\n\nHowever, I disagree with the NA/AA part of this. I found that IOP was incredibly helpful for my recovery. It's a lot more personal than meetings. I felt like I got a lot more out of it than any meeting I ever went to. As long as you put the effort in and are going to a relatively good program, it's a wonderful transition from residential. I always recommend moving from residential to IOP to meetings. YMMV but I have found this essential for my recovery.
