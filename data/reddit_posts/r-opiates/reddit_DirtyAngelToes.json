My mom used to work in the World Trade Center when she was in the army and had friends that had died. She had the radio on and suddenly I realized something terrible had happened and I remember crying with my mom even though I didn't understand the full extent just yet. We got home, turned the news on, and sat in shock as we watched the towers come crashing down (I believe it was around an hour before they started falling) and news stations kept airing footage of victims jumping out of the tower to avoid the fire. \n\n17 years later and it's still upsetting to think about a lot of the footage that was released.", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dwwexhn": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Can the community give their input whether or not you guys think these are real?", "1_Text": "You can get a pack of testing strips for like $20.
