Sometimes I can seem to hold off fine, but mostly it causes extremely fast orgasm.

Considering how opiates tank your natural testosterone levels, at least getting bloodwork done to see if you need hormone replacement therapy is a great idea. I wouldn't recommend using steroids if you're going to continue to use opiates because they don't tend to go well together. Opiates tend to make you lose focus of your goals, and lifting will take he back burner and you won't get great results. If you quit and use steroids, I would suggest your first time running would be just testosterone only. Once you start adding in hormones that aren't native to your body, side effects can really become prominent. After running testosterone only, if you tolerate it well, then you can look into adding some other compounds in. If you do decide to do this, getting bloodwork is very important because you can permanently damage your body. Testosterone aromatizes into estrogen so you will need to get bloodwork done mid run to find out how much to increase or decrease aromatase inhibitor dosages. Without an aromatase inhibitor estrogen levels can get really high which will cause you to grow glandular tissue behind your nipples which is called gynecomastia aka bitch tits.
