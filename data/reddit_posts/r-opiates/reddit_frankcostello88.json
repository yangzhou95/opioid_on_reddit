The dodge gran caravan and the Volkswagen Routan are both the same exact van and I\u2019ve had ran into these issues before. If you\u2019re in the states and your van has less than 100,000 miles on it you should qualify for the warranty the federal government makes dealerships give out as far as emissions and power train related problems go. Some states are only 50k-80k miles warranty on the emissions part. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your tech is completely innocent but I\u2019d definitely give him some slack I know that\u2019s probably frustrating to read. The warranty will apply to the van even if you\u2019re the 1000th owner of the vehicle it just has to be 10 years or less in age and 100k miles or less in usage. Hope that helps.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d also check for recalls according to your vin number which you can easily check online or call a dealer. I\u2019d check both regardless.

You don\u2019t have to call the manufacturer for said warranty(Unless it\u2019s an AMG Mercedes), the dealer will handle that part just thought I\u2019d make it simpler. \n\nPower train warranty only applicable to proven mechanical failures and must be covered by the manufacturer thru the dealer of course. There is a TSB (technical service bulletin) on that specific transmission I just can\u2019t recall exactly what it is..
