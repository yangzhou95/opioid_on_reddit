I would consider myself successful for being mid twenty something male in the US.. (own a home, car, all bills paid, no excessive credit card debt, no kids, social life and many friends.. etc..) but not as happy as I once was. Chasing the high has become extremely old and my dependency won't let me away.  \n\nUnlike you I just liked to party and get fucked up so I had no real business taking oxy and then dope when the pills ran out, so only myself is to blame. \n\nI do think that it is possible to be successful and achieve your goals but it will be challenging. Make sure you keep yourself a backup stash so you can get well on days you are out and need to work. Maintain a healthy diet. Exercise regularly. Do not isolate yourself from friends and family. Keep your work routine the same (don't start showing up late, leaving early, long lunch breaks).\n\nJust know that it is possible to do, and if you can get a job programming or any type of computer gig you should be able to maintain pretty well.\n\nGood luck I hope you can manage your pain successfully and just know that if you ever feel like the opis are getting out of control that there are people who care and will help.
