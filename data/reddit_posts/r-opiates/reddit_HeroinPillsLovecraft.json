On my last night in county, this guy gave me some k-pins to carve his friends face up with a shank.  The thing is the guy wanted this face carved up so he could say he fell and go to the hospital, but his friend could not bring himself to carve on his buddy.  So I'm just chilling on the k-pins and carving a line over and over (dull shank) above the dudes eye.  He's sitting there with a rolled up wash cloth in his mouth looking at me in my eyes, desperately wanting it to be over, but telling me to keep going.  Which was I'm sure a very strange experience for both of us.  He did not get to go to the hospital.
