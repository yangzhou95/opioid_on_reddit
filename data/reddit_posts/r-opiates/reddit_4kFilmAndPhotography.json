He was drunk 1st thing in the morning back in 2014. His son hopped into the car to ride with him to the store. Once they got to the store he pulled into a parking spot. His son began to get out of the car, here's what he SAID happened. He said his son opened the door and stood up, his dad tried to park the car and put it into nuteral ( his car being a 5 speed, that's manual to you females). Due to the massive amount of alcohol he consumed all that night and into the next morning, he struggled, grinding the gears so bad that his son sat back down, legs still outside of the vehicle, asking \" what are u doing dad \" laughing at his dad.  As he stood up again to exit the car, his dad mistakenly let his foot off the clutch, the car jerked forward, knock the boy to the cement, belly first, dragging him forward. Hanging on to the door is all he could do, which resulted in the rear tire gaining traction on his feet, forcing him to let go of the door. This resulted in the boy being ran over, his legs, hip and back all crushed under the weight of a vehicle which was being operated by a VERT intoxicated , loving, father. \n\n\nDon't believe me??
