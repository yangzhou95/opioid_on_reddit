And I did impatient, it was called Four Circles and it was a wilderness program where you backpack through the Appalachian mountains. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to someone who\u2019s coming off of methadone because they don\u2019t give you anything to taper, you gotta do it cold turkey.  And as for the lack of emotion side effects, I think that\u2019s because of your methadone, because when I was coming off of my gram a day habit, I had a flood of emotions after about a week. After about 2 weeks it was all out of my system and I was hiking and camping, enjoying nature and seeing the worlds natural beauty, smiling from cheek to cheek. If it weren\u2019t for that treatment center, I wouldn\u2019t be sober today.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dw2ocvd": [{"0_Comment Submission": "8 months clean still going strong", "1_Text": "You backpack with a group of 6-8. It depends on your therapist on when you can leave and you have to complete different books that have like challenges in it, like starting a fire with steel and quartz rock.

Yea I know what you\u2019re saying about the methadone thing, but I don\u2019t judge anyone that\u2019s trying to get clean. Technically it\u2019s not \u201csober\u201d but if it lets you get off heroin then do it. If you have thought about vivitrol though you would have to get completely clean or else you\u2019re going to have the worst withdrawals of your life.
