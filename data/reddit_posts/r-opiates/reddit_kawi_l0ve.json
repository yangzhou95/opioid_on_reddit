(used kratom to come off hard opiates, specifically fentynal) and I have found that magnesium before bed and Advil help to calm the restlessness and pain a bit. In the morning I would take B12, potassium, and something someone recommended online that has been a huge help is a supplement called \u201cAdrenal PS\u201d purchased on amazon. I take one cap in the morning and one around 3 or 4pm. It\u2019s a mix of natural herbs(ashwagandha, vit c, b6, L-tyrosine, ginseng, and a bunch of other natural stuff that im to tired to type out Lol) it really helps the adrenals which is key in withdrawal since it seriously affects that area. I found it helped calm my anxiety and restlessness (specifically anxiety) and gave me a little energy boost/motivation which helped while I was at work through withdrawals. I also used a lot of weed through the acutes and still do in the evening because it helped me tremendously and I just really enjoy it, always have lol. If your able to see a doctor Clonidine was helpful thew the acutes to help with restlessness/ hot&cold sweats and I found it helped relax me while I tried to sleep. I also used a benzo for the acutes (NO more than 7 days) but I don\u2019t recommend that route as it is highly addicting and way worse to get off once you are dependent(it can happen very quickly too so I cannot stress enough to proceed with extreme caution if you do get a script for a benzo, also having someone you trust to hold them for you and only give them to you if you are in absolute need... helps so you are not tempted to pop them all day and night)\nHope this helps!
