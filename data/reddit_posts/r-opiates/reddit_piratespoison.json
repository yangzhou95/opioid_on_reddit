Nobody believed my friends when they would tell other people that piratespoison smokes weed. In my community I was always that type of kid explained the \"hard math\" to everyone. People had such high expectations of me. Teachers all told my parents to send me to a better school. (Trudeau's school, and his dad's and many of the Qu\u00e9bec elite) I was that smart guy who would probably become a doctor or engineer or something. So my parents thought also. Then I started weed. Then weed daily after school. Then weed ALL day everyday. Still managed to somehow pass school. Then started cocaine xanax and my one true love : hydromorphone. So much potential thrown away. I see people who I never thought would amount to anything succeed. Just by putting in effort. If im able to pass these classes while working 20 hours a week AND while getting high on hard drugs every damn day. Just imagine what I could have done if.
