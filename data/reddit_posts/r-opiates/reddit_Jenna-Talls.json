I live that life for many years. The first time I went on Suboxone I was on it for 3 years. I know it seems like an incredibly long time but once you start a drug like that you literally need about 2 to 3 weeks of your life where you can put things on pause to withdraw. It is worse than coming off of heroin. I've never done heroin but working in the medical field I have seen people in withdrawal on a daily basis. After I went off of Suboxone I had a great 2 years but then I began to relapse. I am now on it again and have been for a year-and-a-half. This time I started out at being prescribed 16 mg then 8 then six but the whole time I never exceeded more than six and now I average two to four a day. I know I have a hard road ahead of me coming off of it again but this is the second time it's probably saved my life. I do know a lot of people sell it but it is mainly sold to heroin addicts to get them through until they are there recover or score again. You really can't dissolve and shoot the films, it's just nearly impossible. If somebody intends on abusing drugs while they're on Suboxone they tend to ask for Subutex which doesn't have naloxone. Suboxone is not an opiate but it is a partial opiate Agonist. You don't get high on it. I can attest to seeing two different doctors on two different occasions and the doctors themselves don't really know much about these drugs nor how to truly help you I believe they get into the business just for the money. It is very hard to find a doctor that prescribe Suboxone that also takes your insurance. Most of them want cash. Some even sell the Suboxone out of their office for cash. I wasn't aware of a shortage of this medication but I suppose I could see why there would be one. I also started using a mom-and-pop pharmacy that is next to the doctor's office and exclusively prescribes to his patients. You get tired of being judged and discriminated against especially if you don't look like your typical addict. Which there really is no look for a typical addict because it can happen to anybody from jail to Yale. If you are a pharmacist just treat your customer with at most respect as you don't know what they are dealing with and don't assume that they are selling it or abusing it. That's just my two cents.", "2_Subreddit": "pharmacy"}], "dwqs8u9": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Is it really possible to taper down where your brain heals and you don\u2019t have withdrawals.
