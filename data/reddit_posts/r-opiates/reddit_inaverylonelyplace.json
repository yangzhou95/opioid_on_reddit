So don't even worry about that.\n\nEdit - also you most likely will use it all immediately, if you're smoking it. My God is That ROA more-ish. You probably won't use it as quickly if you're eating it, or snorting. So I recommend that you do that. I wish I had never smoked it, because honestly it's as addictive as smoking heroin, maybe slightly less actually as smoking black tar heroin is my FAVORITE thing in yhe entire world, and I still crave it and think about it every day and it's literally been like a year since I've done any...... I really fucking regret that actually, trying heroin is the dumbest idea Ive ever had in my life, but I mean I was suicidally depressed so maybe I didn't attempt suicide or anything, all because of heroin... So maybe the fact that I've done it is both a good and bad thing. Idk. Ive done so many dumb things in my life.........

Make sure you avoid garbage food like hamburgers and chocolate. Eat a lot of beans. a LOT. lots of important nutrients particularly fiber and potassium. Eat a fair amount of fruit like 2-3 servings a day, more if you can. Whole grains are cheap, so eat 1-4 servings a day of things like brown rice, quinoa, etc, if you can even stomach food while ur on meth. Vegetables are good too obviously, but they can get expensive (talking price per calorie here). Brush your teeth at least 1x a day. Make sure you're hydrated always, aim for lemonade colored piss. dont be afraid of taking short breaks from using. \n\n\nAnd You could try taking precautionary measures so it's harder for you to get addicted, ie have a friend or SO hold onto your money or something and only give you small amounts at a time, and if you need more than that, just have them make sure that you bought or paid for whatever it is that you said you were going to.
