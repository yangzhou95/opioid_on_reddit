So I was able to use more.i saved a lot of money at first until my tolerance doubled and then tripled and then quadrupled until I was spending twice the money on dope than I was on pills in the first place\n\nAnd suddenly shooting up doesn't seem so bad because you switched to heroin and you don't feel any different.. it can't be that bad. So you start and repeat the same cycle again.\n\nBy that time the withdrawals are way worse because your tolerance is so high so quitting feels like it's out of the question.\n\nAnd I went through all this with Tar, before fent was as big as it is now. So this doesn't even take into account the massive increased risk of overdose with all the fent cut dope around now days.\n\nSo yeah, switching to dope is some serious shit, or at least has the potential to be.
