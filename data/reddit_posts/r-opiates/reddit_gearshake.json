The drug will take hold of your mind and you will use everything you have until you have no more and you will sit there, depressed, on a rough comedown, craving more cocaine as if you\u2019re in a desert starving and you haven\u2019t had any water in 3 days. It is sick and twisted how it makes you feel. I don\u2019t know anyone or have ever heard of anyone successfully shooting coke just once. It\u2019s not entirely impossible I guess, but very, very unlikely. \n\nEdit: My efforts are not to convince you not to do it, btw. If your mind is set, there is nothing I can do.

It doesn\u2019t seem to gradually come on, it just slams me into the roll. Very intense for a few minutes and then it subsided into bliss. Also what do you mean by snowballs. Speedballs?

Thoughts?", "1_Text": "It reads 12mg/30mL which comes out to 4mg /mL\n\nEdit: upon closer inspection it appears I made a mistake, and the bottle actually reads 12mg/mL @ 30mL, so it would be correct to assume that the advertised dosage is indeed 12mg/mL. If many people believe it to be underdosed, one of two things could have happened in my opinion:\n\n1. The label was misprinted and the manufacturer meant to advertise 12mg/mL \n\nor\n\n2. The label was not misprinted and the manufacturer placed it there to maybe confuse people/make more sales, and the solution is, in fact, underdosed at somewhere near 4mg/mL.\n\nAnother scenario I can see happening is that the manufacturer intended to make a 12mg/mL solution, but somehow messed up the math and/or didn\u2019t mess up the math but lost/destroyed a large amount of etizolam during the (surprisingly easy) process of making the solution. \n\nEither way this isn\u2019t cool.
