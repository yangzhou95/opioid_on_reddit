Surprised he had it on him. I've had a situation exactly like that where the dude took my $200, and I ended up sitting on his couch for 3 hours with the 2 fat chicks watching cartoons.

I kept asking for my money back and if i could just bounce and go somewhere else but he kept saying \"na my boy will be here in 1 min just chill\". Then after ALL THAT I ended up having to drive him to 2 different locations before we were ever able to cop.
