Help?", "1_Text": "If they want to quit, they will. It has nothing to do with you. They love you very much, but they made the decision to smoke before you and it\u2019s a hard addiction to overcome. The only way for them to quit is them to want to, which them ignoring your concerns shows that they don\u2019t want to and they don\u2019t do it to hurt you. I understand you\u2019re worried, I\u2019m sorry to be blunt but some people smoke and some people don\u2019t. Maybe try to get them a vape with nicotine in it? They can puff on that while still smoking, and they can try to taper off it. A lot cheaper too!

I like to smoke a few bowls, eat everything in sight and eventually fall asleep. I tend to be pretty responsible on xanax actually and rarely agree to going out on it and if I do, always leave my wallet at home.
