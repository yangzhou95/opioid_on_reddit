Started slipping $20s out of the register to fund my habit, obviously wasn't making enough to take care of my habit. I got fired last year after getting so many chances to stop stealing, I just couldn't stop, the idea of getting sick was too much for me.\nSo yeah, I know what you're feeling.

It was rough for me because I was the boss of all these high school kids who worked there, they always would ask *me* for permission to do things. I would yell at them for being late, fucking up, etc. so everybody really lost respect for me once it was out that I was a junkie stealing from the register on a daily basis. You couldn't pay me to show my face in there again. \nHe threatened to call the cops, said a million times \"Kara, I should really just call the police and put your ass into jail. I really should\" but I don't think he could do it, despite what I was doing, he always said I was the best worker he ever had in his 20 years in the business. I feel like I probably hurt him a lot by doing what I did, too, so the guilt factor is there .. but it's definitely difficult to feel guilt when you're in the midst of this awful addiction. Nothing matters except where the hell youre gonna get the next fix. And admittedly so, I am still struggling with this.\n\nAll you can do right now is put this behind you, start job hunting again, try to start over. Could you still use this job as a reference for a new one? When I apply to places I still put my pizzeria, cuz I don't think my old boss really has the heart to ruin my prospects of finding new employment (plus, after 10 years he was paying me absolute *shit* and he was an incredibly cheap, money hungry man.
