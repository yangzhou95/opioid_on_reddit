I got to my terminal and most the seats were taken except a few. I looked around and a woman made eye contact w me, and shit you not sort of like waved me over w her eyes. I was wearing a suit because I had meetings all day and she immediately commented on what I was wearing. I thought to myself \"is this real life? This shit never happens to me.. \"\n\nAnyways we got to chatting, and I told her flying is boring. I always have a few drinks before flying because wtf else am I going to do.. it's boring as hell!  I didn't know it then, but she was about to change my life for good. She looks at me and says \"you want a couple Percocet?\"\n\nI immediately said yes  -to be fair I knew what I was getting into, I had friends w problems and everything but I said fuck it I'm gonna do this. I didn't know pills at the time but I now know I took 20 mgs, and I was high out of my mind. We aggressively flirted the entire ride back to our home city. She was showing me naked pictures of her and shit, I was talking absurdly loud about how fun it would be to fuck in the bathroom on the plane and shit lol fuck it!  Looking back I can't even imagine what the poor people on the plane had to sit thru... hilarious to some, repulsive to  others I'm sure. \n\nWe got off the plane, exchanged numbers , etc and then shit got kind of weird w her.. she wanted me to sell her hubby weed and I just got wicked sus'd out and thought they were cops so I totally stopped talking to her. \n\nNow that I think of it...
