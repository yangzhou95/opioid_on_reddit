Od\u2019d in dec then moved back to the middle of nowhere with my mom and siblings. I was 80 something days clean. I took some of my dads painkillers when i was over by his house this past weekend, couldnt help myself but lurk around the ol medicine cabinet. Found half a schoolbus in my wallet and my sis bought a dab pen. I was debating taking the pills and smoking. And then i did. I felt guilty as fuckk the first night. I was layin in my bed stoned and just couldnt stop thinkin about how im gona have to tell everyone. But forsure that was the one and only time i was gona take pills and smoke. Pft. That was on sunday. Its about to be sunday again. The next day i drank some codeine, took my half xan and smoked. And have been smoking everyday since then.

I used to trip a lot a couple years ago and always had a good time. Then i got into pills and eventually dope. When i would trip while addicted my trips were filled with anxiety but only if i smoked weed while peaking. So my advice would be to try it out but have some xans or somethin else to take you down if you feel its too much.
