In reality I bet they would just lock up anyone who looked at a soldier the wrong way.\n\nPeople like to view soldiers as if they're all unquestionably heroes. That might have been true in like WW2 when they were out there fighting nazis and fascists, but today's soldiers are mostly the akin to the worst kinds of cops that work stateside who are killing/beating people for no reason. I don't know if you've had any interactions with many cops these days, but they treat people as if you're below them in pretty much every way possible. They're supposed to view citizens as guilty until proven innocent, but it's the complete opposite in reality. Either way, cop or soldier, they're both tools of a corrupt state. These people are even worse when they're signing up to be assholes. They just want ot go to another country and shoot brown people, not to save people from tyranny or oppression., or to save people from genocide. \n\nSorry I went on kind of a rant about how much I hate these people. It's really not a good response to what you were saying but I just couldn't help myself.
