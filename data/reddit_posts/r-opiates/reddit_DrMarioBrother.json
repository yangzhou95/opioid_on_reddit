Examples of opioids that Narcan can't reverse well are carfentanyl, etorphine, and bupenorphine.\n\nWhile bupe doesn't get regular users with previous dependency and current tolerance caused by recent use/permanent tolerance, it can get someone without opioid tolerance EXTREMELY high from as little as 500ug of bupe. If they snort say 4-8mg and OD, naloxone will NOT save them.

That's the entire fucking point of it all dude, lol. No reasonable person would ever want to take on that risk themselves. If you're going to smuggle, do a single trip with like 500g of fire dope. Part of the problem is that completely FAKE drugs are a massive problem in South America, Mexico in particular. And you'd have to constantly do border crossing with illicit drugs without a prescription. It also doesn't sold the problem of the US having a monster cost of living. In addition, the gringo demand in Mexico is huge, so they're not going to give you 50 xanax bars or 100 valium 10s for $3 like in Cambodia. It's going to be like $2 per xanax bar or $10-20 per Oxy 20. There's also no opium there sold on bar menus, and the heroin is better quality than the west coast USA, but it's still crappy tar. SE Asian heroin is the real China White, and as long as you're getting it from a real source it's going to be like 70% pure on average, well above 50% pure every single time. They're more focused on charging you double than cutting their dope, since nobody really uses a scale in SE Asia.\n\nCan you live off $20 per day rent included in Mexico? Can you get lightning internet for like $7 per month in Mexico? Is your water bill only $2.50 per month in Mexico? I doubt it dude. Like yeah it's cheaper than the US, but it's not Cheap. In Cambodia, the tourist price for ~10g of ~10% thc weed (yeah it's not medical-tier but it's not crappy Mexican brick or Indian schwag, which I've had both of and it's HORRIBLE) is around $20, or ~$2/g. If you find an actual dealer in Cambodia and start buying like 20-30g at a time, it's only around $1-1.50/g. There's no way you can get it that cheaply in Mexico and still get 8-12% thc, in such small quantities, for that cheap. \n\nI don't think Americans in general understand how absolutely potent the heroin is in places like Laos. \"great\" street dope that's fent-free is only like 20-25% pure max. Dope in Laos is 50-85% pure depending on where you get it/who you get it from, and it's CHEAP. Much more import than getting dope 3-7x stronger than back home for only $15-40/g is the fact that there's NO FENT AT ALL in SE Asia, and if there is it's extremely rare. They don't have the resources or the demand to cut their dope, because people aren't weight obsessive like they are in the US. Nobody is running around with a 0.1 or 0.01g scale complaining to their dealer that it's 0.1g short in places like Cambodia/Laos. They're already getting it dirt cheap like $5-10/g for 70% fire dope, and since you're paying like $30-40/g because you're a tourist foreigner, it's just more convenient for them to sling raw or at the most short your gram a little bit. They're already making 300-800% profit lol.\n\nThat's the biggest reason man. I don't trust North American/ South American dope at all, even with my test kits. There's absolutely fentalogues that don't come up on the fent kits that dancesafe sells, and dancesafe's test kits are by far the best on the market. You don't think cartels haven't tested it themselves? I'm not risking my life on fenty American/Mexican dope tbh, that's just my opinion, and it's the reason I've never gotten high off dope once. My whole point was finding a place you could actually afford to live and do dope daily lol. How are you going to afford to live, eat out every day without cooking, pay all your rent/utilities/bills, AND still buy dope for less than $1200/month in Mexico, especially near the US border? It's just not going to happen. I'm talking about a permanent lifestyle choice/change, where working just 20 hours per week via a remote/online job is enough to live well, eat well, have a maid, and get high every single day on good dope/pills for under $1200/month once you figure it all out.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwwsm80": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Anyone ever think about going on a drug holiday in SE Asia?", "1_Text": "Yeah, I haven't been myself, just have 3-4 close friends IRL who have gone (more than one) and have described in striking detail how they were going to score.

Why not expand your mind man? Do you enjoy not being as educated as you possibly can? I would LOVE if people pointed out when I spelled things wrong or got a concept wrong, because it will help me avoid continuing to look like a complete idiot in the future. \n\nYou're conceptually the worst kind of person, at least in the context of our discussion. I can't speak for how you are as a person otherwise, and it's not my place to judge anyways. What I mean by that is that people who get offended when it's clearly just them being offended, simply because others want to help educate you, is pretty lame and indicative of someone who's not comfortable with who they are and how they're viewed by others. Please stop projecting your level of uncomfortableness onto others when it's clear as absolute day that how you received what they wrote is the complete fucking opposite of what they intended from their end.\n\nI genuinely pray for you that you'll some day grow up/grow out of this world view. It's not indicative of learning new things or broadening your mind whatsoever. There's no reason to get defensive over being ignorant over something when the optimal, mature person would just absorb the new information like a sponge, thank the person who educated them, and then move on. Perhaps you could even forward the new information to others when it's relevant to the conversation, helping them to rise up from the uneducated masses. \n\nNew information and being an informed, educated person is ALWAYS a good thing. The sooner you learn that and take it to heart, the better off your life will be, as well as those around you. And no, I'm not just talking about knowing about benzos here. I'm talking about your attitude towards shying away from education in general. You seem like one of those people that shove your head into the sand because for some reason you see that as more beneficial than just facing the noise that is reality.\n\nRarely do I EVER respond like this, but the sheer magnitude of how quickly your responses went to shit are absolutely uncalled for. I even said I didn't mean to be rude whatsoever, yet you managed to state \"never contact me again\" in your FIRST reply. That's not the point of Reddit whatsoever. How are people supposed to engage in discourse or point out when someone's objectively wrong if the recipient has an attitude to new information like yours? \n\nThis is Reddit, you're not entitled to be walled off from the truth. I never even messaged you, I just wrote a public reply. Public replies aren't just for you, they're for others. If I were to let your comment go by unreplied, others might think that what you posted is actual correct information, when it's not. For example, it's extremely unlikely one would actually go to jail over possession of a benzo without a prescription, whether you're in the west or in Thailand. It's much more likely you'll pay a Thai bribe and move on.\n\nI suggest you consider finding some other corner of the internet where you're entitled to remain blissfully ignorant about things you seem to actively seek to remain ignorant about, because I can tell you right now that Reddit is NOT that place at all. The whole point of Reddit is public discourse and being open to response/constructive criticism for EVERY post you make and EVERY reply you post. Again, if those things make you uncomfortable, then Reddit is absolutely NOT the place for you.
