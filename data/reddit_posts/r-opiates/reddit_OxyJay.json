I think mentally the biggest thing for me is realizing that I actually am able to effect positive change in my life and even others. \n\nThe biggest problem in my life is that I was a victim and so nothing was my fault and I couldn't be expected to change my life, etc. Now I know that if I want my life to get better and stay positive it's up to me to put some work in.\n\nAnother thing is mentally I realize that nothing is ever as urgent as I make it.

Let people judge for themselves. The problem with addicts is that we want everything to work like drugs did and that's not how the real world works. It takes time and it takes fucking up a bunch to get it to work.\n\nIt's like saying basketball is fundamentally flawed because not everyone who tries it once gets to the NBA.\n\nI'm all for people doing whatever makes them better.
