There are a couple different variables. One that most people don't consider is tolerance. Buprenorphine has an activity ceiling limit and it's only a partial agonist. If your tolerance is greater than that limit, the subs will give you absolutely zero relief, even if you've waited long enough to avoid pwd. That's why I stopped fucking with subs and switched to methadone, induction was always 3 days of agony. Methadone is worry free, you don't have to wait to be sick and there's no ceiling. \n\nEither way, when inducting with subs I've found that microdosing .25 to .5mg every hour or so is much more comfortable and even if you fuck up and dose too early you only get a flash of pwd.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwv2a1t": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Phenobarbital & Suboxone treatment", "1_Text": "Wow that's strange.
