If you took it on a full stomach then I guarantee you that\u2019s what did it. You could try dissolving it in some water and drinking it as it will hit harder and faster. It\u2019s gross though, might mix with tonic water, quinones good for opiates though it\u2019s pretty negligible in tonic water. You could try working out and exhausting yourself before taking it cause you\u2019ll feel it more if you tired or beat up. \nI remember when 20mg would have me writhing in bed in rapturous glee. I remember one time I\u2019d had a panic attack at a bar with friends and made an ass of myself and ran out and drove away bawling cause my emotions are fucking bullshit, and I got home and took 20mg to calm down and good lord, everything was as it should be. Beautiful. Now I take 100mg and it gets close but it depends on the circumstances, sometimes it just mostly sedation instead of euphoria. It\u2019s also a lot of Tylenol. I guarantee you your tolerance has gone down, there has to be some other factor going on. You could try some Benadryl before you take It, or DXM.
