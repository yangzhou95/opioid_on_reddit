Last hooray before getting sober for good", "1_Text": "I hustle on the side to support my habit. Mannnn I make 80k, doesn\u2019t mean I take that home! I probably take home 60k. It\u2019s crazy too cause from the outside nobody has any idea how bad my life is at this point, In terms of being a full blown junkie/addict. I drive a $80k car, have a great job, everyone knows me as successful. I got into a nasty motorcycle accident about 6 years ago now (wow can\u2019t l believe I\u2019ve been fucking with these blue little pills for more than half a decade... sheesh....) and that\u2019s how I got hooked. That was when I was 18 y/o and a senior in high school. I worked at this Fortune 500 company my junior and senior years of college which is where my addiction really took off. And I graduated 2 years ago from college. Since then, my addiction has got much worse, primarily because I\u2019ve had the funds to support it AND i have so much free time. All I do is work 8-4... before I used to be up at 6am go to class all day and then work all day at my internship ($25+/hr) and then go to the library to study after work. I was able to do them recreationally for a while before getting addicted and having a 4 blues a day (120mg) habit. I got on subs from a friend for 8 months after that and then tried getting off them (was only taking 2mg a day) and withdrawal was terrible. I relapsed and then graduated from college and that summer I spent all my savings ($35,000 in 3 months). I got clean off everything, even stopped drinking. I was on vivitrol for 6 months and got clean myself no detox or rehab. And then about a 14 months ago I reapsed again. Every relapse worse and worse. I got clean 2 times in between off everything for a week or two and should\u2019ve got back on the shot but I relapsed time and time again... and that\u2019s where I am today. Still trying to stop killing myself daily with this horrible addiction. The daily sickness/mental health issues (depression, anxiety) have really taken a toll on me as a person. From the outside everyone thinks I have this awesome life, which in a way I worked so hard for and earned for myself l, but little does anyone really know that I\u2019m one of the most depressed, suicidal, self loathing people. I guess I\u2019ve lesrned money really doesn\u2019t equate to happiness. It just causes more problems, in my case, addiction. I continue to make POOR decisions on a daily basis just to support my habit. If I could get back every dollar I\u2019ve ever spent on blues, it would be well over $250,000 in the past 4 years alone.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwbcae7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Scored a 100 pack of blues...

I\u2019ve never not been able to get them, which in turn has perpetuated my addiction. I\u2019ve had 3 really really close life friends (not just drug friends) lose their life to heroin overdoses. I\u2019ve had countless other friends die as a result of opiates addiction too. But specifically heroin overdoses. I pledged to myself I would never do heroin, not because doing oxycodone is not as bad as doing heroin (because it\u2019s not, in my opinion they\u2019re the same thing as equally as bad. Either way you\u2019re an addict), but because i pledged to myself I never wanted to make my loved ones feel the pain of losing me over doing heroin. I know it\u2019s the same thing, I just like the fact I know EXACTLY what dose of opiates I\u2019m doing. Heroin is playing Russian Roulette\u2026 You never know what you\u2019re getting and you can easily overdose with all this fentanyl out here. The day I can\u2019t find blues and or can\u2019t affofd them maybe I\u2019d consider heroin. Till then I\u2019m all set.

I\u2019m a engineer I graduated with a 3.8 GPA from a top 10 public university. I work at a Fortune 500 company making 80k a year and a hustle on the side to support my habit. It\u2019s sickening when I think how I fell into this trap and how I haven\u2019t switched to heroin yet. This has been going on on and off 5 years, everyday for the past 3 years with 1.5 ish years of sobriety, half tnat on suboxone half that on vivitrol. Im trying to get my shit back together, this is a $2000+ dollar a week habit. When I add up how much I\u2019ve spend on blues it\u2019s sickening. 300k at least... I could have a house paid off by now, I drive a 70k car and live a pretty good life. Everyone thinks I have it made (which I do in a way, I\u2019m not complaining, I have worked my ass off to get here DONT get me wrong) but money doesn\u2019t equal happiness. Only if I could get sober. Honestly my testosterone is so depleted I stopped caring about girls and anything but getting high... it\u2019s pathetic man. I\u2019m trying to get back to where I was... just 2 years ago I graduated from college with 50k in the back paid off 40k car and staring my great job. Now I live paycheck to paycheck while approaching a 6 figure salary... all because of this addiction. I\u2019m honestly ashame, I want help but don\u2019t know how that get it. I don\u2019t want to disappoint my family again they think I\u2019m clean but after I got off vivitrol I relapsed it\u2019s been about 14 months of relapse with maybe 3 weeks of clean time in between. I really  want to just stop this habit for good... you know how much money I would have? It\u2019s sick dude it really is.
