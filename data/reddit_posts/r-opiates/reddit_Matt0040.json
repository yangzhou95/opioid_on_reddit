Again, take them orally, much less tweak, longer duration.\n\nIf you **need** to wake up, and I mean you have no choice, cut one of the addys in half. Orally dose one 20mg pill. When you feel the 20mg comeup, snort half of the other addy. Keep the rest of the addy you cut for later, you might need it but I can't say for sure.
