I've been doing CF for about 2.5 years and have simply focused on consistency. I've noticed there's been a great variation in my physical capacities as my moods change. This was really difficult at first because some days I'd totally kill workouts and others I would give up and have to walk away. AND THAT'S OK.\n\n\nIt took a long time, but knowing that I won't always have \"it\" in me doesn't mean all this effort to become a good athlete has gone to waste. There are some days I'm at the top of the whiteboard, and others where I leave before the WOD. \n\n\nI think I'd just like to say that no matter how mentally tough you are/have become at CF, you should take into account the strength of a disease like bipolar.
