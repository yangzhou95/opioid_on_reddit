I have had an amazing past few days.  Rather, an amazing month, as I just came from a WONDERFUL treatment center last Friday and checked into a recovery house upon discharge.  I've been hitting at least two meetings per day, fellowshipping with the recovery community (including my housemates,) and just had my first IOP this morning.  I found a truly fantastic sponsor on Sunday morning and every time I talk to him, I feel my Higher Power working through our interactions.  I've had little struggles here and there, but have talked them out in meetings, with housemates, and with my sponsor.  I've never felt more passionate about anything in my life as I feel about recovery.  50 days clean today, and taking in so much about this beautiful process.  If you'd have told me two months ago that I was about to undergo a spiritual journey that would lead to this degree of wonder and awe, I would have told you to piss off while I banged some dope.  I'm deeply grateful for everything I've been through, continue to experience, and whatever my Higher Power has in store for me.", "2_Subreddit": "OpiatesRecovery"}], "duw8ifb": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How naive is it to think you can use heroin daily as a part of your lifestyle?", "1_Text": "You already answered your question, but I think it bears emphasis that you will not be able to keep it going forever if you use every day.\n\nEven if you're not WDing and haven't destroyed your life yet, you've allowed yourself to *believe* that you \"need\" the dope.  That promise of the next high is irresistible, is it not?  Desire and its bastard child, obsession, can be the most difficult thing to contend with in life.  However, it is never too late to change your beliefs.  \n\nOver the past several months, I have been reading a lot of works by psychologists and neuroscientists who are currently pioneering the addiction field, and most of their philosophy can be traced back to the works of the great Dr. Albert Ellis.  He created a self-empowering, highly effective  psychological tool in the '50s called Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, or REBT.\n\nWhat Ellis did was revolutionary, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many mental health professionals today.  He often worked with addicts, alcoholics, people who were struggling with self-confidence or motivation problems, and found that by changing one's *beliefs* about obstacles in life, they could overcome them.  \n\nOften, we think of therapy as sitting on a couch and boo-hooing about our feelings, right?  This approach puts the ball in the client's court.  You can feel or think a certain way and express it all you like, and while there may be some benefits to doing so, you're not really doing anything about those thoughts and feelings.  REBT tells us that we can acknowledge what's referred to as (A) - the Activating event (constantly craving dope, for example,) (B) - our Beliefs about it (\"I *CAN'T* stand this obsession,\") and (C) - the Consequences of giving into our beliefs about our problem (using over and over again, Hep C, going to jail, etc.)  Ellis believed that if we challenged the (B) in this scenario by thinking realistically, critically, and rationally about the consequences of giving into (A), we could take the power away from all three of these things and change the way we perceive our problems.  By conquering our urges little by little through reframing our perspective, we gain more self-confidence and it becomes even easier to discredit our previously strong beliefs about our substance use.  Do that several hundred times over (not by resisting urges, but by discrediting their power,) and you find that the drug or behavior doesn't have nearly the power over you as you used to believe.  \n\nAddiction CAN be a harsh, lonely, heart-breaking road.  It certainly was for me when I was using heavily.  OR on the other hand, it can be a mere obstacle that you encounter and get over, just like any other problems you run into in life.  It doesn't HAVE to be the doom and gloom - that foregone conclusion of despair that society reminds us of.  It certainly can be if you choose to buy into it, but it can also be conquered with rational thought, critical thinking, and self-empowerment.\n\nYou don't have to buy into the disease model and the 12-step philosophy of \"powerlessness\".  I learned this the hard way and refute that garbage every chance I get.  I was a sick, foundering junkie shooting around a gram and a half a day.  I believed I had no prospects and no future when I got to rehab and the 12-step machine.  They reinforced that thinking and told me that without their way, I'd die a junkie.  Their way was something like this - admitting powerlessness, believing that I am diseased and will be for life, telling me that there's NO WAY I can get better without being subservient to a sponsor and turning my will and life over to a higher power, making me find all of my faults and atone for them via prayer and amends, and proselytizing this pseudoscientific faith healing nonsense to others.\n\nI drank the Kool-Aid and put all my eggs in that basket until I realized that I was deluding myself.  I reject ALL of that crap and am doing just fine.  Life is beautiful and full of possibilities, and I'm a bright, capable, promising human being. Why?  Certainly not because I prayed for \"God\" to \"remove my 'defects' of character,\" but because I began to believe in myself again and started changing my beliefs about life struggles, depression, and drugs.  I can choose to use or I can choose not to.  There is no wrong answer.  \n\nSorry for the rant, but if anything I said strikes any kind of chord with you, please do yourself a favor and check out SMART Recovery or just plain old REBT.  It has proven to be a crucial tool in my life and allowed me to stop feeling guilty or sorry for myself and get on with life.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "duw9ju4": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Sub doctor arrested...this left for 400 now sick patients", "1_Text": "You're a far more gracious person than I for scribbling out that quack's name.
