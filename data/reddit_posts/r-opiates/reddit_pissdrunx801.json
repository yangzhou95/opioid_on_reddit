As someone who has been down that road many times (relapse, trying to chip), I can tell you the most obvious, glaring thing about your situation: it\u2019s not fucking worth it! But you know this. And it sounds like you\u2019ve already made up your mind to try to chip. We all know how that ends up. Maybe you can do it man?? I know I can\u2019t, and haven\u2019t seen it done successfully. Only you can answer that and decide. As someone who was in a similar boat recently (clean for several months, relapse) and is actively using heroin again, I have no place to discourage you from continuing to use. I can say that it\u2019s dark and fucking miserable though. Sure, there are brief reprieves and moments of bliss, but the trade off is a shitty deal. If I were you, I\u2019d reconsider your plan, and think of all the good shit you could possibly lose. Cause it sounds like things are going good for you. As a fellow addict, I\u2019m notorious for taking a good thing and burning it the fuck down. Good luck, man!

How would you rate the severity of your \u201ccondition\u201d (for lack of a better term)? Meaning, are you simply bad at empathizing, or typically have little to no empathetic responses at all? How does this condition manifest in your life and everyday interactions with other people? Do you find yourself having \u201cun-empathetic\u201d responses to people (thoughts of violence, maybe, or like imagining someone getting hit by a car without feeling any shock or sympathy)? \n\nI\u2019m reading over this, and I apologize if these questions are crude or too personal. I\u2019m also happy to hear that your experience with LSD was so beneficial and insightful. I\u2019ve learned so much from acid: about myself, my thoughts and feelings, also the world and our place in it.

There were often false positives associated with medications like that, especially the anti-depressants and the anti-psychs. Although it does seem strange that you would have that many false positives. Regardless, if you haven\u2019t taken those substances, the lab should clear up any discrepancies. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. As far as your OB, you\u2019d be surprised how much ignorance/misinformation there is concerning drug testing (and drugs in general), even in the medical field. That, and the stigma of addiction. Medical professionals should know better, especially when it comes to how they interact with addicts or potential drug users.
