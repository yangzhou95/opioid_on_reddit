I\u2019ve heard stories before and I thought to myself how lucky I\u2019ve always felt protected , in a sense ... There have been many situations I would always fall back on in the back of my head thinking \u201c everything is okay\u201d you have a guardian angel , you know ? \n  And yes , I don\u2019t have any horrible memories of my mom being drunk , or anything like she was abusing me or stuff ... she just became very depressed and couldn\u2019t cope with life and found the bottle.  She was my idol, my best friend and mentor .. my mom was everything I still want to be ... amd she was loved by everyone .. years would go by and we would have just that look without saying a word , like don\u2019t worry about it , grandma\u2019s going to take care of it .. kind of thing ..   I never remember seeing her face, it was always her sitting at an angle kind of , with her back to me busy doing something .. only can remember the same clips in my memories too ... folding laundry, like socks and small sized clothes bcuz how delicate she folded them . Her singing only a verse of a song with the swan it , and the 2 memories but different items she was knitting or crocheting, one was a blanket , rhe other was a sweater bcuz I see the arms being held out checking it ... special to me that I was blessed with this .. and it makes me truly believe \u201clove knows no bounds\u201d  more true than ever :)", "2_Subreddit": "Kratomm"}], "dwq0jbb": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Kratom close to FDA regulations, legal in Michigan for now", "1_Text": "\ud83d\ude18", "2_Subreddit": "Kratomm"}], "dwq6x7t": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Weekly Open Discussion #12 - Do you believe there is intelligent life on other planets? ...

You wil pay the piper !!!  Because of irresponsibility on yours and theirs part,  the rest of us that respect and use a plant RESPONSIBLY should not be punished or loose the freedom of choice!!! God Damn it !!!  1,000\u2019s of people use kratom responsibly!!! Elderly people that were never drug addicts have serious medical diagnosis and find relief with kratom ... They are not standing in line at the front door waiting for a fucking headshop to open up so they can get their fix!!!  Veterans that served in the millitary with PTSD and have lost limbs, and have been on a buffet of meds , take kratom responsibly to seek benefits that kratom provides without all the negative side effects from several rx\u2019s .... THEY ARE NOT STANDING IN LINE .....   Moms and Dads , Aunts , Uncles , Grandparents  ALL walks of life are NOT represented in your ridiculously lumped in statement that rhis plant should be illegal , because a small percentage ABUSE it !!!!   This pisses me off !!!  Their consumptions or however many days a week they use , do not all have these ridiculous high amounts like you read stories in here ...  \u201cI took 20, 30, 60 grams a day .... \u201c  WELL MUTHERFUKR NO WONDER YOU ARE FUCKED!!!\u201d   Headshops serve a very small percentage of people , considering  that many people who take kratom have NEVER even seen a headshop before ... stepped foot in one .

Thankfully,  I got clean well before it got banned,  but as soon as it was scheduled, people came out of the woodwork,  protesting that it was safe, and not addictive, and not any worse than coffee.  There is still a petition to bring it back.  I am thinking, are you all crazy?  When I use to do Kratom and get it from the head shop, people were lined outside the door as soon as it opened like a methadone clinic.  Families would come in the store and beg them to stop selling to family members, because it had ruined their lives. I was one of them.  I lost everything because of this drug.  Don't tell me it's harmless and no more addictive than coffee.  That is straight up bullshit.  There are some studies done now that say Kratom might even be as addictive as heroin.  \n\nTHIS IS THE COMMENT THAT PISSED ME OFF!!!! \nBESAUSE NOT EVERYONE THAT USES KRATOM ARE DRUG SEEKING ADDICTS !!
