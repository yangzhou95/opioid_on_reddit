I'm in the same place right now and have been for a while. For me it's pot and heroin. Before, I used alcohol but it became too hard on my body. Every day I feel less and less like a person and more and more like a husk. The only pleasure I get is from smoking pot or heroin. I don't know the way out, though most would probably say to start with quitting.

I guess I'm seeing your post and realizing some things about myself. Look, I wish I was on your side of the tracks and not my own. Save your money. Get out of there as soon as humanly possible. Call your brother once a month and buy him lunch. He probably isn't eating if he's like most of us scumbags and it'll mean the world to him. Just don't give him money when he asks, buy him a beer instead. He gets his peace and you know you didn't give 20$ to heroin. Plus you get to meet him in a neutral location. Until that day comes don't get bogged down in their bullshit. They're going to take everything out on you because you are a normal person with emotions that they know they can manipulate.
