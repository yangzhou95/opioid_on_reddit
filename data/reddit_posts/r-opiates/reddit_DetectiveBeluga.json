I know like you just said you are, but keep yourself busy and if it really gets to that point you can find homeless shelters/hostels or food pantries.\n\nAlso, I would avoid going to a McDonald's or something where they require you to buy something to stay, I say head to the library or somewhere on a college campus, you can charge your phone and laptop and chill.\n\nI know it sucks being 19 and on your own like this because 19 year olds are the age no one gives a fuck about but PM me if you start to go crazy from lack of interaction lol I'm more than willing.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwx0lrv": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Why do you go on one last binge before rehab?", "1_Text": "You're gonna miss it anyway.

But you aren't worthless. You start out with nothing to get something. Don't throw the rest of your life away because it's getting hard for a bit. According to your post, you are going to be homeless in a couple of hours. You don't even know how fucked you are yet. Be smart, be sober, and you will get by. You'll eventually get a job, I promise. Just don't fuck up your job either because you're getting high too much. Save those bars, they'll come in handy on a bad day. But if you think that after you pop them you'll likely kill yourself, chuck those down the fucking street. Seriously, don't be another statistic about drug deaths. You don't have to do that.
