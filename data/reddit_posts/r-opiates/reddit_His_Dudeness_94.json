I am pretty interested in all-American characters like Bucky Cantor. He seems reminiscent of JFK with his emphasis on duty, an attitude which seems to have been prevalent and commendable among Americans in WW2 for understandable reasons. He's a playground director who feels responsible for the kids under his care, when a Polio epidemic breaks out in the summer of 1944. This is an opportunity for Bucky to serve his country even if he is not risking his life at the front lines.

His disdain for God, which had been sparked by the Polio outbreak, grows when the epidemic takes hold in the Indian Hill camp as well. \n\n\nIn the final chapter we see him as a crippled shell of his former self, embittered and in self-imposed exile. He sees himself as guilty for the Polio outbreak at two locations, he also feels guilty for not serving his country in the war. He purposefully ruins things with his girlfriend and, unlike Job, never reconciled with God.\n\n \nAll in all, 4/5. Highly recommended!
