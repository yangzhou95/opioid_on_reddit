I enjoyed the hydrocodone afterwards. Bought some kratom after that but kratom wasn't all that. At 19 I acquired LSD and damn real drugs were my new hobby. At college I started drinking alcohol because I couldn't trip every weekend. Middle of the year of college I had a dmt breakthrough and saw the hyperspace. End of my freshman year of college I started smoking weed, spring break in Colorado. Took an high dose edible and would have lost my shit had I not been accustomed to psychedelics. Many psychedelics, empathogens, and dissociatives have been consumed since. \n\nThe only class I found troublesome was stimulants, chasing godhood has its downsides.\n\nEdit: None of my friends openly did drugs until college.
