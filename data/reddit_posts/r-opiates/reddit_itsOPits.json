However, I do think vivitrol gets an unfair shot around here. I do have experience with it, and all it does is make opiates completely useless. The mechanism involved has nothing to do with natural endorphins, I don't get why people say that. I think people get depressed because many go on it prematurely and are not ready to end their use.

SHARE your experience!", "1_Text": "Whenever this topic comes up, it bothers me the reputation that vivitrol gets based on heresay stories. From my EXPERIENCE, here is the thing about vivitrol. If you want to get clean, it is great. If you're just doing it to please people, it's just gonna add misery. When I was on it and wanting to stay clean, it was great. You know when you're trying to stay clean but you get a text or you walk into a situation where you can use and temptation is too much? Vivitrol is great for that because it eliminates that moment of weakness. You can't use it as your only source of recovery, but it can be a very helpful tool to help recovery along.\n\nAs far as natural highs go, this is just a badly repeated falsity. Your natural endorphins work just fine. The reason that people get depressed on it is they no longer want to stay clean. If your still entertaining using thoughts and looking at dope porn etc it's gonna be miserable. It's like staring at chocolate cake all day while on a fast, of course it's gonna be miserable. \n\nYou do need to be committed to it, as others warned. Trying to break through it and use can lead to easy OD, and when you get off of it, your tolerance will definitely be lower, so there is always danger there. Also, I still drank while on it. They say it helps to prevent drinking but I never really noticed a difference while drinking.\n\nSorry for the long post, but just wanted to share my experience. In all honesty, I'm using now, so obviously nothing is 100 percent successful. But when I was committed to staying clean, I really felt like it was beneficial.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dqnxm5j": [{"0_Comment Submission": "My doctor and family keeps pressuring me into receiving a VIVITROL shot.
