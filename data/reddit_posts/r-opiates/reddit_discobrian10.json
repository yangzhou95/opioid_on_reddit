Every drum has a note it resonates at. You can tap on your shell without heads on it and get an idea of what note it is. Timbre is what this is called. \nThis is how drums work. You tune your reso head to the timbre of the shell, and you can tune the top head up to a minor 3rd above the reso head note. This is where ear comes in. The closer you tune the top head to the reso head the \"flatter\" the tone is. This is what you would do with a floor Tom. The higher above the reso head you go with the batter head depends on how much \"pitch bend and fall\" you want. Find heads that your drums like the best, and stick with them. Or don't. Don't really care, just thought I'd tell you the mechanics of a drum. Cheap drums are \"hard\" to make sound good because of the wood and construction of the shells. You'll find that the more you pay for a kit, the better it will sound because they take a lot of time to choose the right wood, the right grain cut for different plys of the shell makeup. I am a professional studio musician/ touring musician, and record drum samples off my kits that I tune, so people who can't tune or don't have time to tune can rush through a session and replace their drum sounds with my samples. I'm not saying go out and build an sjc kit or get a dw collector series, but I wouldn't take a first act or tama rockstar on stage or into a session and expect it to sound like a $2000 kit. Just remember these are just guidelines on how to tune. Drum tones come down to a lot of factors like drums sticks, rim size, how hard you hit them, where you hit them, and how consistent you are with hitting them. All kits are made different, but the tuning mechanics work the same. \n\nThanks for reading. Take what you want from it, this is how I do it and it works for me EVERY SINGLE TIME. Consistency/ time efficiency is key.", "2_Subreddit": "drums"}], "drakelu": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Need help crushing pills", "1_Text": "I\u2019m a little late posting, but I\u2019ve found the best way to crush is get any body spray can like axe or whatever flip it upside down put your pill in the bottom cupped part of the can and use a screwdriver handle to crush it up. Then just use your favorite tooter. I take a zebra pen apart and use the metal tube because they are small and last a long time compared to plastic pen tubes. Have fun and be safe!
