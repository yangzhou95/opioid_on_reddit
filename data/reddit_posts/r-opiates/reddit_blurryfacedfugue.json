First, the neurochemistry of it all, and the neurotransmitter binding to for example, the mu receptor responsible for some of that euphoria (iirc, its been a while and super rusty).  The other thing to consider then is your own personal relationship to that substance.  For you, it is a stranger.  But for an addict being high is part of their normal.
