Went to first rehab at 19. Was able to remain clean for a few months after getting out, than eventually relapsed in the sober living house I was at.\n\nMoved back home across the country and went to another rehab in my home state. Managed to stay clean for 3 years after that stint. Started using pills again around 23. That quickly turned back to heroin, and I used for the better part of a year again. \n\nCaught a felony charge and went back to rehab at 24. Got out of that rehab and managed to stay clean for about 9 months. Started doing pills again, than back to dope. And here we are at 25, back on dope. Not as bad as I've been though. This run I haven't picked up a needle at all. Was always shooting in the past. Also keeping my use pretty low right now. \n\nPlanning on putting again soon. Hopefully I can put together years of clean time again. This whole on again off again thing has been going on for 8 years now and I'm ready to get off the carousel.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dvf2yb7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Im becoming an old man guys.", "1_Text": "My brother is 66 percent gray at 28.
