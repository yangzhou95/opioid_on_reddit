I didnt have money to buy it, couldnt steal shit , and couldnt even find anything decent even if i had money. All that was around was weed, pyscadelics and meth. So i stopped. but i lived close to the beach and there was always good waves. So i started going to the beach and bodyboarding more. The adrenaline rush after getting sick barrels over the shallow reef took my mind off the dope and after spending hours out there, you just feel good and tired and content along with making lots of friends. Obviously it was and still kinda is at the back of my mind (why im on this sub) but it was just not available so i just had to deal with it. And so thats what i did for like 2 years just go beach bodyboarding like 3 or  4 times a week for half the day. Fast forward to now I havent done anything in like 7 months, I moved to oahu north shore about 4 months ago doing what ive always  wanted to do bodyboarding pipeline and waimea and all these other sick spots. theres tons of girls and it just feels like a dream. yesterday i got to thinking remember when you were like that all you could think about was dope and now i hadnt even thought about it for like a week straight and man it feels fucking good. I do smoke a lot of weed and hash tho so that helps a little", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dg6fnws": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Keep your saliva away from your gear when IV'ing", "1_Text": "oh jesus", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dg6g1vs": [{"0_Comment Submission": "When it's your last $140...", "1_Text": "meth sucks", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgahqf4": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Seemed like every one came through today! :)", "1_Text": "wow thats shitty 140 $ for 4 pills...", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgahse9": [{"0_Comment Submission": "So I got 216 mg of hydromorphone last night for $100 along with some other drugs I was given for free!", "1_Text": "sharing is caring brah. with me. thats my suggestion", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgb9du4": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Seemed like every one came through today! :)", "1_Text": "are  those op 40s any good? i heard it gels up or somethin", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgfpaf8": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Daily medication for 5 years now.", "1_Text": "sounds pretty sweet. my tolerance builds so fast", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgvpj05": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How to make oxys last?", "1_Text": "tagamet before  the dose. some benzos.  a big fatty meal. lots of weed and cigs", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dgvr81v": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Growing Khat or Coca....", "1_Text": "i live in hawaii and know somebody that grows it at sea level.
