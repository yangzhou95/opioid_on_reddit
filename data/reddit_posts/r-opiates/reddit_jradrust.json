I went to school that day a good Christian. I came to my English class (I should probably mention I am in the bible belt of SC) and heard everyone arguing over the different types of Christianity: Protestant, Lutheran, etc. In that moment I  just thought to myself, this thing can't really be real if all these people are different types, so I made a big mistake and questioned religion. I asked them \"Do you think all of you could be wrong\" and I was labelled as a heretic from there on. In the heat of the moment of everyone screaming bible scenarios to me, I just blurted out \"I don't believe in any of this.\" So I went home and asked my dad who was a priest who had read almost every work of \"God\" and he said if you read it all it contradicts itself in every way so probably none of it was real.
