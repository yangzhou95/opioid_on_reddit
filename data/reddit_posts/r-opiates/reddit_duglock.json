I have a few friends that are gay and Trump supporters and loathe the left for the very same reason. If you want a good insight into the subject I'd recommend Jonathan Haidt's book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion. What it all boils down to is that those on the left make decisions based on 1-2 moral matrices and those on the right use 5-6. Pretty interesting book. He was an evolutionary psychologist hired by the Kerry presidential campaign to analyze voters and what they responded to. He is a liberal and I think does a fantastic job of leaving any bias out when describing the right.

It seems odd or contradictory to you from a logic standpoint because you misunderstand the position. Haidt did a neat experiment where he took members from all over the political spectrum and had them pretend they were a member of another political party and then write down that parties positions. It revealed something which I found completely counterintuitive to what I would have guessed. Conservatives and blue dog democrates/centrists could identify, explain, debate, etc left, middle, and right points of view. He found that those on the left completely misunderstood the positions and beliefs of those in the middle and on the right. I consider myself a right leaning centrist, for example I voted for Bush's first term but Democrat or libertarian since then. I always assumed when people on the left called conservatives racist, sexist, etc it was just a cheap insult designed to shut down the conversation when they didn't have facts on their side. It was due opening to me to f8nd in the study that no they actually believed that 100%. All in all I'd just really recommend it if you are interested in morality or ethics. Another person you might find interesting is Dietrich Bonheoffer. He is considered the founder of Christian ethics. He was a priest and traveled to Germany during ww2 and was executed for attempting to assassinate Hitler. While awaiting for his sentence to be carried out he wrote while in prison and it is just great stuff.
