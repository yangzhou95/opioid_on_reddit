Since when does throwing fucking rocks result in open fire from the Israeli soldiers? The Palestinians are so poor, no military, that they throw rocks. No amount of rock throwing should result in an open fire on all of the protesters.\n\nImagine if this happened in America? Would riot police shoot into a whole group of protestors just willy-nilly because a few of them threw some rocks? Absolutely not.
