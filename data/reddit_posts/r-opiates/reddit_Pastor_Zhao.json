It's dextro and some other shit(it just Adderall with different name). Anyway it makes me calm depending on how I'm feeling that day. If I just need something to get rid of my agitation then it helps, social anxiety goes to a 0 on amphatimeans.  However, sometimes you go full tweaker and you don't even notice it. It's fucked up but true, like you talk a million words a minute and you don't even aknowledge the fact ur speeding. If it's making you calm and not euphoric then you're probably just an addict now and you'll only feel the effects of the withdrawal leaving you. You probably have no choice but to take a tolerance break.

However fear may be your best combat. Fear the negative health consequences, the fact you've made it this long and you're gonna have to go through hell if you wanna reach this point of sobriety again. I'd say find something else to get attached to but sobriety can give you months of demotivation and disinterest and it may just fustrate you. Think about who you wanna be and what needs to be done to get there. When people do drugs such as meth, there rarely ever is a happy ending to the story.

Most people feel like they NEED stims just to function so they can get through the day. Once sober it hits them, social anxiety, stress, trouble focusing, sleep issues. It's going to be hard, but the drugs aren't an option. It's going to lie to you and make you believe that it'll fix you. Even after suicidal comedowns somehow it'll still make you think they will help you. I wish I could give you advice but sobriety for the most part is quite simple, don't do drugs(It'll be anything but easy though).Because there isn't much physical withdrawal other than a feeling of being weak and sleepy then it may not even take that long for you to get back into society. But it could still take months before you feel like the sobriety was even worth it. You also may get fat btw(if you're not already).

But I think when people die from self-destructive behavior it's because for whatever reason they mentally can't deal with life. People who OD likely don't want to die but it's still the same premise, it's people avoiding their problems. If someone doesn't feel like they can handle their problems nor feel like anyone cares then they're slowly going to stop caring about their own life. I just don't believe it's fair to blame only the substance, There's psychological and enviormental suffering that changes you as a person.
