What kind of ass hole judges someone and challenges them like you have? I really am a pharmacist and worked pretty fucking hard for my license. I work mostly with diabetic patients who want to learn how to control their diabetes. I was taught pain in a 3 week lecture series and have numerous textbooks that include pain. I have access to databases like lexicomp and micromedex, and have read numerous inserts, you fool. I'm not ashamed of myself. I look back to my junkie days and I'm glad I am not dead because I would put damn near anything in my veins, once I did ketamine, thinking it was speed, and nearly died. PhDs cannot write scripts in the US. Pharmacists will not fill scripts from a PhD, because they do not have prescribing rights, it is not in the scope of their practice. I'm not a dumbass. Sufentanyl is 10000x more potent than morphine, which is why it is used in elephants only. The books where you find this information are called under the classification of medicinal chemistry.  It is never a straight conversation either, but an estimate. I realize that my level of education is well above most on this page so I took down the post. It had good intention, since there are too many deaths, but people took it the wrong way and wanted to challenge me. If someone wants to do a drug that they are unsure if it's contents, by all means, go ahead. I used to. Just trying to help. It's my duty as a pharmacist to help others. I miss my days of doing strong shots and getting fucked up beyond belief and having no responsibilities, but those days are long gone. I cleaned up, finished my first bachelor's, then went to pharmacy school, graduated, got licensed, got an amazing job, and help people who want fucking help. Sorry you too it the wrong way and don't believe I goddamn pharmacist. Short if giving you license number, which is a hell no, fuck that, never will.
