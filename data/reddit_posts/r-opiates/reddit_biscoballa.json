I'm prescribed adderall and I can't take it for at least 5 days when I'm transitioning to sub. I actually started out on vyvanse and absolutely loved it. There's no huge peak. It's a fairly even plateau. However, I wanted an IR for \"breakthrough\" days when I really needed an extra boost at work (vyvanse doesn't make an IR). My doc didn't want me on two different types of amps (fucking retarded) so he switched me to add xr and add IR. I wish I could go back to vyvanse. \n\nMy issue with adderall is that a lot of times I get too focused or antsy and don't get shit done. Where as vyvanse, I could barely notice I was on anything but it worked really well", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "d8sqgt7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "How or why did you guys and gals start using needles?", "1_Text": "Your pharmacists?
