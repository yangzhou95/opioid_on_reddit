I just learned something totally new and interesting, thank you for posting this.\n\nFor years I've always said that there are two kinds of people...those that take opiates and feel \"up\" on them and enjoy the effects and those who don't get any enjoyment and always say \"It just made me tired\" I've had loads of people agree with me and I have tons of examples that validate this.\n\nI've always thought it had something to do with me having ADD. Uppers like amphetamines or cocaine will make me chill the fuck out. Everything is just kinda just whatever...I become a lot quieter and relaxed than sober/opiates. When I take opiates though, I get energized, I go on walks, I want to do things, I feel \"up\"\n\nOne of my best friends is the opposite and it's always so funny whenever we do drugs together. We'll snort some rails of coke and he's constantly standing up, moving around, talking non-stop, etc and I'm just sitting in a chair...smoking a cigarette and taking everything in...not really having anything to say.\n\nI'm excited to do more research on paradoxical opiate reaction now!

A statement on par with that but reversed is quick to have tons of people up in arm's but I'm the only one to comment on this... PEOPLE can be \"trash\" or \"treasure.\" Everyone is responsible for their actions alone. \n\nYou love Transparent so you should remember Josh and Rita, no? Her actions were much more calculated, abusive, and traumatic...they also have proof (I am speaking in terms of the shows universe) unlike the actions of Tambor, which is only hearsay. So I guess I should say \"Come on Rita......Why are women such trash :(\"\n\nComments like that further the negative attitudes that believe women have it out for men and lie about their abuse. You are fueling the fire of idiots whogeneralize that way and putting yourself right alongside with them since you do the same. Hold individuals accountable for what they have done when you have verifiable PROOF and have investigated a scenario without bias. Don't generalize and give a voice to untrue and negative statements like you have made here. That gives you credibility.\n\nAlso I have to say, I am sure you said that as a one off comment. I hope so at least. I say things all the time that a comment like I just made could be written to me. Everyone does. Nobody is perfect and that again goes back to PEOPLE being perfectly flawed.

After the \"mindset\" wouldn't end and  the visuals wouldn't stop, I did some research and accepted that for the un-foreseeable future I would have to cope with a disorder I had never known existed. I already had enough on my plate and this was the icing on the shit cake.\n\nI was tripping on various psychedelics often, smoked weed all day, and also abused a plethora of other drugs. I used cocaine and oxycodone/heroin daily. GBL, MDMA, methylone,  Klonopin, Xanax, Valium, various members of the 2C-x family, and research chemicals from A to Z. I was dealing drugs in \"large quantities\" (About 15 to 20 pounds of marijuana a week) that I sourced from a particular gang of Asians that starts with Y. I had more money than I had ever seen moving in and out of my hands that I tried to keep under wraps while also trying to share the wealth with the cult of friends I had and my family; the family who lied to daily and told fabricated stories to keep my real life from being discovered. I was in two serious romantic relationships that exploded into a world of problems I can't even summarize here. All of this kept me under an IMMENSE amount of stress. One night my door was kicked in while my girl\nfriend and I were having a beautiful conversation and a gun was held to my head (while I was naked since we had just had sex) and I was robbed out of $00,000 and a few pounds of weed. That event triggered PTSD which also turned into HPPD. \n\nI will always remember the moment it started. I took a bong hit and as I blew out the smoke, I noticed slight fractals and shimmering colors as it swirled through the air. My kitchen table turned two-dimensional and stretched out and then it all hit me super hard. It was like taking a gram of shrooms and two hits of 100ug LSD together. I went silent and completely checked out from my friends around me. I got confused and anxious. I had no issues tripping but that was by choice...this was forced and without warning. The visuals lasted for a few hours and I thought it was going to be an isolated incident. I was wrong. The next day, same thing; a bong hit turned into a ++ level trip.\n\nI'll  have to type up the events following that day sometime,  but HPPD stuck with me for months and finally went away in rehab after I had a little over a month sober. For two years I would have the occasional \"glitch\" in my brain that induced a visual/visuals. To this day, I can \"force\" visuals and see tracers, albeit slight, on moving things. The hardest part was constantly having the mindset of tripping. At first, I semi-enjoyed it but it quickly deteriorated my mental health and stability. The mixture of stress and being on a psychedelic trip called a disorder got me very close to having a psychotic break. \n\nI would encourage you to stay off drugs and take extra care of yourself for a while. Talk to people you trust and don't let yourself go too deep with things. If you have trauma, now is the time to process it. If you ever want to talk to someone who has been there and understands, PM me. I will help as much as I can. You will get through this. I keep journals and during that time I wrote a special one about my HPPD which helped a lot. SLEEP! You NEED to rest your body and mind right now. Before I knew I had HPPD, I had delusional thoughts that I had \"reached a higher plane\" and that my mind had evolved which led me to exacerbate the problem. Please be careful and stay relaxed. You will come out of this experience at some point.
