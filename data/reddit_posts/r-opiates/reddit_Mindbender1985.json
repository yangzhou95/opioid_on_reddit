I'm an addict and have put my wife through the ringer (13 years of off and on relapse and recovery). Rehabs are a lot of false hope for the addict and loved ones. Rehabs are constructed to fail, straight facts. Sounds like he is in a deep and dire situation. He needs help, yes! You by the sounds of it have done everything in your control to make him \"BETTER\" but he has to be the one to make the change. Co-dependence sounds like a real issue at hand you are facing and you may need counseling of your own to understand his or her disease is out of your control. Wish you both the best. Suboxone and weekly psychiatrist visits have turned me back into a functional husband and father to my precious 2 year old daughter.

As harsh as it sounds you must have him evacuate your premise and stop enabling him. He will try any and everything under the Sun to guilt you into his next fix. Your living situation is very unhealthy and needs to end like now. And if he isn't willing to leave call the cops. If he won't go detox medically then maybe jail is the next best place for him. Just remember you can't save him or erase his addiction. Cut ties and wish him the best but letting him hang around isnt helping either of you, kicking him to the curb may just be the reality check he needs to accept real help. I would leave immediately before he or you does something that you can't erase. Addicts hate being called out on their shit, speaking from deep experience.
