The detox was weird from the get go. We were not allowed even Tylenol or any \"drug\" and I had to withdrawal from heroin cold turkey. Many sleepless nights but we wernt even allowed to take a nap during the day.. The weirdness began about the second day when the blank staring robots who worked there would direct us to \"look at that wall\".. so I would look at the wall and they would say \"thank you, look at that clock\".. This would go on for hours and the end result was suppose to be a \"cognition\" like \"omg I realize I do drugs because my father beat me\" or some crazy shit like that... After detox I was let out of the crazy room and graduated to the next step of the \"program\"... I was introduced to all the \"students\" who were a bunch of fucking losers... Don't get me wrong I was a drug addict and not the best person but these people who were being \"treated\" here had some serious issues besides drug abuse. The second phase of the program had 8 books or levels foresay all written by the founder of scientology \"L. Ron Hubbard\".. The first book was the craziest and basically said the reason that all people act up is because they have a \"misunderstood word\".. So while reading these books the staff would periodically check in and clear words from the curriculum and ask for example \"what does the word THERE mean?\" and I'd be like \"are you kidding me that word has about 100 different usages and contexts\" and so they'd be like \"well that's incorrect you have to read the entire book over from the beginning. This madness went on for a long time.. Next part was a sauna program where we would sit in the sauna for 15 minute intervals for about 4 hours a day and each day take more and more niacin to the point that you would have a reaction similar to allergies where your entire body would tingle and turn bright red.. This went on for 30 days and I worked my way up to like 2000mg of niacin a day.. After that we had to write down every single thing we did wrong in our entire life and have some creep in a dark room review everthing we wrote untill he felt we had revealed everything. We had to reenact situations in our lives with clay characters and do those \"objective exercises\" I mentioned in the beginning for hours and hours for weeks on end. The craziest part was that we had to sit in a chair and stare at another person across from is for 2 hours straight without moving a single muscle, couldnt even scratch and itch which is fucking torture and if you did at say the 1.5 hour mark you'd have to start over from the beginning.. This sent me into a rage and nearly caused me to freak the fuck out. Long story short it was a brain washing boot camp for the church of scientology hiding under the guise of a treatment center giving absolutely no rehabilitation to people with legit issues and charging folks $50k or more..

They totally want to recruit people at their weakest point.. A lot of religions do the same thing but scientology is much more sinister imo.
