Not like when I first started taking it and not super out of this world. Here\u2019s what I do. Again this is what works for me. Everyone will definitely be different. \n\n1. First pill 600mg on an empty stomach\n2. Wait 30 mins. Take second 600mg\n3. Drink a Canada Dry. Apparently carbonated drinks enhance it\n4. Wait 20 minutes. Take 300mg\n5. Eat a few Slim Jim\u2019s or fatty snack. Not a full meal but something fatty. Like a slice of pizza or something\n6. Take last 300mg \n7. Finishing my Canada Dry off lol\n8. Depends on how I\u2019m feeling but sometimes I\u2019ll pop a few Etizolam right after but usually I don\u2019t crave my Etizolam as much when on Gabapentin but I do like the combo \n\nTotal = 1800mg.
