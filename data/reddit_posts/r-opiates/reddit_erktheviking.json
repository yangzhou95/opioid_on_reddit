Drugs will always be there and people will always use them. Nobody forced me to use heroin, you are right about that. It was a choice, but a choice made by an extremely sick, depressed and suicidal person. No healthy and happy person choices to buy heroin. I think people need to look at that fact. But instead of paying 10x the amount to lock up, incarcerated and punish drug addicts, it would truly be more cost effective to get people into treatment and mental health services.\n\nI am not saying let drug addicts who steal or hurt people off the hook, by all means lock those people up. But the people who spend years in jail for simple possession should have gotten 30 days in treatment at a MUCH lower price. Hell 20 low cost treatment centers would still cost the tax payer much less than years in jails, court appointed lawyers and fees, and Court ordered Alcoholics Anonymous is free.\n\nJust keep an open mind on drug addicts. We're sick people who can absolutely get better. Letting people die will never get rid of all addicts.
