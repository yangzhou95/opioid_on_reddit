So I hit the chick up, she wanted me to meet at a sketch hotel, I pulled up, walked and saw the car, total beater. I knew then it was legit and the pills were legit. So it all went well, I stayed good for the 4 days I was there finished the last one off as I was boarding to come home.\n\nCrazy what we do to satisfy our addiction isn't it?

It was a good 2 hour drive from my place but worth it, I came out 5 days later clean as a whistle, past all withdrawal symptoms and a script for some clonidine which was instrumental in getting past WD's. All in all it was completely worth it, sure after that you're going to be mentally vulnerable, but google medical detox in your area and I promise there is a program out there you may qualify for where it won't cost you a dime other than getting to their facility. \n\nI personally had to get there super early, and hope I was one of the 10 they might admit that day depending on how many left. It was sketchy, but all in all I got in. Although after I got in I sat there watching person after person get denied which was kinda sad when they WANT to get clean, but the place can only support so many people at once. \n\nFelt like a prison kind of, and I was around some much harder people than myself.
