So many people on this site swear up and down that you can get \u201c no good Kratom\u201d from a local store. But I have come to find it is total bull shit. Don\u2019t get me wrong you can find some great vendors online...but let me fill you in ( and everybody else in) on a little information... EVEN PEOPLE THAT OWN HEAD SHOPS HAVE TO BUY IT BASICALLY FROM THE SAME ONLINE VENDORS AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES. And I\u2019m sure that they don\u2019t want to be buying and selling garbage Kratom to get a bad rep for their selves . So with that being said it wouldn\u2019t be logical to sell shitty Kratom out of your store. Is it possible that people have gotten shitty Kratom from a head shop? Absolutly. And it\u2019s just as possible to get shitty Kratom from and online vendor ... bad batches are bad batches no matter who orders them. Now one substantial difference I can tell you basically is the price. Obviously tho because the store has to make their money as well.. cheers!", "2_Subreddit": "kratom"}], "dwtope2": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Nothing beats having enough that I can probably out running withdrawal for a while", "1_Text": "That looks like having enough to keep me from witdrawal for about 6-8 hours lol.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwtowuh": [{"0_Comment Submission": "I dosed 4 grams of kratom at 11am.
