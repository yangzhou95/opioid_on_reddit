But while it really isn\u2019t all thaaat difficult for people of simple and basic tastes to live on easily less than $100 monthly (I eat mostly ramen) that doesn\u2019t mean we should be issuing such a low maximum amount of fiscal aid to the poor that it\u2019s almost like issuing a challenge to even survive, which takes a lot of forethought and severely limits one\u2019s options. We easily have the money to literally double or at least substantially increase our social safety net programs, and choose not to with many politicians claiming budget deficit while our it would be more than possible by simply shaving off a mere 1%+< our annual military budget. Regardless, it isn\u2019t like you can very easily spend your food stamp cards on meth or anything of the sort, they\u2019re worth far more when purchasing allowed items anyway and it\u2019s pretty obviously more efficient to just spend them on food for your family directly. I\u2019m certain that the majority of us could hardly stand even using foodstamps at stores, yet we focus so much on regulating exactly how much financial assistance we supply to our rapidly growing population of impoverished citizens. Our priorities are completely fucked when you realize we\u2019re, say, spending hundreds of millions annually to combat harmless drug use like weed while other nations are regulating and taxing the hell out of it while turning around and investing that money right back into public healthcare and other social programs, or education, which allows a larger percentage of the population to pursue better paying jobs which in turn results in this growing educated percentage of the population paying more in tax dollars and subsequently providing our government with even more tax revenue etc, not to mention competing with the workforce of other nations a lot more effectively. Yet our current administration is focused on what, again, right now? Trying to build a giant wall? What a fantastic plan...that\u2019ll *surely* help our deficit \ud83d\ude44 I\u2019m progressively losing faith in the intelligence of our population and the republic that governs over it.", "2_Subreddit": "quityourbullshit"}], "dvygn4g": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Convenient things have inconvenient prices.", "1_Text": "Are you sure about your figures? I\u2019ll come right out and say I\u2019ve not researched it whatsoever and I\u2019ll take your word for it but personally I\u2019ve always heart that our total military spending is closer to $800billion than $600 nowadays, and amounts to something close to 40% of our entire budget. I\u2019ve heard that the food and agricultural spending is a infinitesimally minuscule fraction by comparison and within that small sliver resides the food stamp program that conservatives blame in large part for our budget deficit, which even if my numbers are WAY off there\u2019s still no way that what we spend on foodstamps amounts to anything truly substantial in the grand scheme of things. Other, significantly-easier-to-rectify and much larger problems exist, such as our absolutely useless, senseless, and economically idiotic war on drugs when we could mitigate the problem far more effectively through decriminalization, funding rehabilitation, and legally regulating the harmless drugs on the list such as marijuana, which by the was is classified currently as a schedule 1 narcotic in a league with methamphetamine, heroin, and crack cocaine. Even with our current opiate epidemic, oxicodone and other extremely addictive pharmaseusicals are classified  no higher than schedule 2 due to their proven medicinal applicability, as if weed has no medicinal value whatsoever and (even surrendering that point), assumes that it has a high potential to cause serious physical harm, psychological potential for addiction, severe risk of physical dependence, and a significantly high level of lethality, each point being just as patently absurd as the last. Take the money we\u2019re pouring into private prison contracts, judicial fees, and especially law enforcement out of our spending column while simultaneously generating insane margins of tax revenue through the taxation of low risk substances like we\u2019ve already done with alcohol and tobacco, and you\u2019re looking at more than enough money to put all the funding in the world towards proven effective rehabilitation programs, clean needle and naloxone exchanges to curb the rapidly worsening opioid epidemic, and you\u2019ll have plenty left over to expand our public healthcare programs, potentially even resulting in very practical taxpayer funded services like governmentally funded ambulance services as opposed to sticking the poor sick citizens with an $800 bill for a two mile drive, and hell we\u2019d probably have enough money left over to increase teacher pay by a fair amount and better our standard of education to more effectively compete with the rapidly growing educated workforce of a few specific other countries. Even if only half of these suggestions were to pan out, it wouldn\u2019t do anything but benefit society as a whole and improve the quality of life for millions. Yet, for some reason, we\u2019re suffocating government assistance programs for the working class and talking about how tall our wall should be to keep out the immigrants who wouldn\u2019t make enough money working to pay taxes anyway. Neoconservatives are terrified of immigrants coming into our country without documentation for allegedly economic reasons, when in reality they wouldn\u2019t be in a taxable income bracket anyway and would simply reap the financial benefits given to the extremely impoverished, doing nothing but costing us money as opposed to working without documentation, still paying sales tax among other ways of benefiting society as a whole, and working in fields that Americans by and large don\u2019t pursue.\n\nSorry I wrote a book\nTl;Dr: stop talking about a fucking wall, legalize weed, fund rehabilitation that actually works instead of mandatory minimum prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, legalize weed completely nationwide and tax the living hell out of it, invest saved money and new tax revenue into social assistance programs, healthcare, higher education, and actually proven effective methods of combating the rapidly growing drug epidemic, and you\u2019ll be amazed at the changes we see in a very relatively short time span. Raising taxes in specific areas while decreasing unnecessary spending is the key to undoing the damage Reagan did to our national debt. Reagan *decreased* taxation on the highest income bracket, losing lots of revenue, increased taxation on lower income groups, squeezing our ever dwindling middle class half to extinction without generating much revenue, minimizing the ability of the average citizen to achieve the now-mythical American Dream that we once held so dear in this \u201cland of opportunity\u201d we all loved, and drastically increased spending on things like our already massive military budget and other such programs that don\u2019t result in a net gain to tax revenue over time, unlike higher education and teacher pay which demonstrably pays for itself and then some when surplus revenue is invested. To undo the damage we\u2019ve allowed to accumulate over the last 40 or so years, we have no choice but to reduce spending and increase taxation on the highest income brackets once again, just like FDR\u2019s famous New Deal programs (you know, the only president who was overwhelmingly re-elected to not two or even three but FOUR terms in office, setting historical records in terms of the popular vote and voter turnout in general? Yeah, that guy, the one the American population absolutely adored and who clearly and demonstrably improved the standard of living in this country and accelerated us further ahead of our international competitors in several different ways? Yeah, like him)\n\nTl;Dr to the Tl;Dr: vote for a progressive who actually has some level of understanding of how important the governmental decisions that his administration could make will affect our nation, economically and socially, as well as the quality of life of every citizen therein. NOT the funny orange clown this time, if you don\u2019t mind. While it was a good laugh, it\u2019s gone on far longer than any joke needs to and is starting to become actually problematic\n\nP.S. Considering the fact that our current military spending dwarfs that of any nation capable of causing us the most remote sort of threat, in fact it is higher than that of the next twelve highest spending countries ALL COMBINED including China, Russia, several major EU nations and India, I think that about a 12% decrease to our annual military spending wouldn\u2019t exactly be the end of the world, and considering the massive beneficial difference that amount of money could make if put towards something more practical, I\u2019m not against a decrease of that magnitude in the least, provided it\u2019s carefully calculated and implemented over some given timespan by those who are better educated on the priorities our military should have regarding it\u2019s budget and which aspects have the most room to lose funding. Plenty of people in positions of power such that they could influence these excellent decisions and take steps necessary to put them into motion choose not to do so for personal financial gain or otherwise some aggregious misscalculation of our nation\u2019s priorities, and such people need desperately to be replaced with those who better understand the biggest economic and social issues facing our country and have the will and ability to begin to change things for the better. Continuing to elect and re-elect establishment democrats and establishment republicans alike will get us absolutely nowhere, and the more time we waste the further we dig ourselves down into this already frighteningly deep economic hole. If we don\u2019t act swiftly, our middle class will evaporate and our working poor will become even less wealthy by the month, opportunities for personal advancement and economic gain will begin to disappear completely and the wealthy elite will gain enough power that these detrimental changes will become nearly irreversible. We\u2019ve already wasted this four year term, we can\u2019t afford to blow many more. Worst case scenario-the United States ceases to exist as we know it today, will cease to be a world superpower either militarily or economically, and will fade into the same background as other once world-powers not unlike the fall of the Roman Empire, but for more easily preventable reasons. Why so many people fail to see the bigger picture of our current political sphere as it stands now continues to baffle me\n\nEdit: Apologies for slight misinformation, as it happens, the highly addictive and obviously dangerous neurotoxic street drug methamphetamine is actually classified as a schedule 2 narcotic, not schedule 1, meaning it allows for at least some amount of limited but effective medicinal properties, as select active ingredients from the methamphetamine family of drugs are occasionally prescribed in extremely small doses for thinks like narcolepsy. Conversely, marijuana is classified as a highly addictive and lethally dangerous narcotic with zero proven medicinal properties and a high potential for abuse. Worse than meth. Yeah, the DEA lists weed, an extremely commonly used recreational substance in maaany states as well as a drug prescribed for everything from glaucoma to fibromyalgia due to its proven effect at treating many such diseases, is listed as being highly dangerous, extremely addictive, and WORSE THAN CRYSTAL METH. But yeah, let\u2019s keep wasting tens o millions of tax dollars by leavig the hundreds of thousands of nonviolent drug offenders to clog our prisons and courtrooms and live entirely off the state unable to work or seek the help they may desperately need. That\u2019s definitely what our country needs, more prisoners who committed such heinous crimes as smoking a joint alone in their own home, for example.
