I've been there in the past and still struggle to feel as though life is worth living a lot of the time. It might be lame but I try to focus on the things I enjoy and the people who need me. I've lived through too many people dying before their time and I know how devastating it is to those around them. I know you might just be posting some nihilistic shit on Reddit and don't actually feel this way but if you do just know that there are people whose lives will never be the same without you. Even if you don't have much family or many friends (not saying this is the case for you) there are people whose day you have made better and if you can just hold on I know it's cliche but it can get better. \n\nI feel as though my life has been a lot tougher due to depression, anxiety, addictions, and other hardships but i KNOW (for me at least) I can appreciate the ups and the good things in life so much more cause I've been at the depths of despair and it makes me appreciate the best parts of life. The awe I have about the world surprises me at times and I've had times that I never could have thought I'd ever be able to feel that. \n\nI know it's stupid and I'm sorry about the novel I wrote but if you are for real about your feelings about life pm me.

The woman says to the server, \"Oh that should be fine.\" \n\nSo this woman goes into anaphylactic shock almost immediately.

The restaurant I work at actually has an entire gluten free menu (and have for a long time before the gluten free \"fad\".) I can tell you that every restaurant I've worked for takes allergies extremely serious. The problem is when it's a life or death thing and the guest essentially say I'm so allergic to such and such but when we tell you we can't guarantee it to be free of \"allergen\" they says it's fine. Trust me, we don't want to kill you.  \n\nIf you are gluten free and they offer gluten free items they should already be prepped in an area that will allow it to be free from cross-contamination. The problem isn't you, it's people who say things like: I'm allergic to tomatoes or pickles or something just because they don't like them.  Generally we can tell who is being sincere about an actual allergy but we still take care to treat every allergy seriously. This means we have to take extra care not to cross-contaminate items that really don't need to be and this creates problems for speed or service and accuracy. What you say that you are doing is the correct way to go about it, saying that you are gluten free because you have celiacs should be enough at places that offer gluten free items. If you go to a place that doesn't specifically offer them may be a little different. This is just because we were trained in a certain way and know what celiacs is since we have so many items and they may not be aware of that and may understand allergies more easily. Regardless, most places should treat it like any other allergy as long as you are clear about your needs. \n\n\nTL;DR: if you say you are gluten free, have celiacs, or a gluten allergy your food should be handled in the proper manner to avoid cross-contamination if it is an establishment you feel comfortable eating at.", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dwagidb": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Chefs of Reddit, what do we all need to stop ordering?", "1_Text": "I don't know what type of restaurants you go to but that's not something I've ever seen in a restaurant.

She was very upset that I was there for so long without ever mentioning anything but since I was so young I thought it was normal. She was a single mother so I know it was really hard to pull me out while working full time.

I'm not sure how old you are but I'm in my late 20s.
