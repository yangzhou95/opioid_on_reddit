I did at 4 Am. At 4:05 i called the dboy. Didnt spend a lot, trying to cut down and save $", "1_Text": "I fucking love hard more than the smack , the soft, or anything else really. Especially since I've started to shoot it.. yeesh is all I can think to say.... I used to think shooting coke was as good as it got, the proverbial Pandora's abox of pure unadulterated bliss, a feeling that actually makes you stop and think for a second.. were mere mortals supposed to experience this.. this... Feeling of unfathomable euphoria.\n\nForgive me, but it's a feeling just short of beyond description. However, in being so close to inexplicable the feeling sometimes escapes definition by me. If i have it setup so as to get some hard w my boy when picking up; the hard is the only thing on my mind. even if I'm kinda sick. And on the rare occasion that there is no hard (they wait till we're face to face and innocently tell me whatever shpeil they've come up with) it comes dangerously close to ruining the whole day... Which results in me doing a mega shot to compensate for the disappointment yada yada yada.\n\nTimes especially like those make me wish I didn't need to buy the smack so I could buy more base... Alas I know better, for I need the boy to come down from the hard. at least a small bit for when I inevitably run outta the rock otherwise I will go insane. \n\nMy buddy will turn into a straight up carpet farming, shadow person seeing, incapable of answering/saying a word to you crack head. I on the other hand remain calm and collected (UNLESS I don't have dope and no way of getting any), then I go straight up Mr. Hyde like my boy lol.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwt8sdm": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Did Anyone Get Their Tax Refund Money yet?

It takes a good 20 min or so at least before you fully recover your mental faculties. I get wicked pissed about this because... Well fuck all that noise.\n\nI'm also mad because I had a good amount of crack left but being the retarded I am, left it sitting on the bathroom counter I presume. Needless to say that's a lost cause. Anyway, I run for it. Give up. Cops just talk to me, somehow can't arrest me. Basically left with a Sophie's Choice and have to take ye olde amberlamps ride of shame. Oh yeah I somehow snuck a crack pipe in my back pocket after being searched pretty well at least twice. And almost managed to save my 4 remaining bags of dope, but the stupid cop said I should take off my jacket before I lay on the gurney thing. I crossed my fingers but as I took it off the bags that I had up my sleeve sadly took a tumble into the cold , undeserving hands of officer friendly. \n\nSkip to now. Went on a bender after AMA from hospital before they finished running all these tests to see if I have endocarditis or something similar. Took the keys to my truck and a couple things to pawn and here I am now. Probation officer is probably pissed, parents are definitely pissed and almost certainly scared/worried. \n\nI just had almost 5 months sober but relapsed on New year's day this year.... Like what the fuck man now look at me, right back to square one except now with added bonus of potential jail time baby!
