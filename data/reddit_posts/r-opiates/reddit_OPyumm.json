Each day you spent $300 On said ten-pak. Picked up 6 days at $300 per day. So in six days you spent $1,800.

I have recently been very curious about people who use and how long they are involved/using. I wonder if there is like an average time one can actually sustain moderate to heavy opiate use. I want to know what percent of users end up quitting vs end up dying. I want to know if/how many people end up maturing out of using if they survive to late adult/early elderly life stages. If anyone is still a user as an elderly person that has been using since their early adult life. I am curious for many reasons but one is that I am Rx'd opiate pain medication and I don't see a scenario where I would not need them for the rest of my life if I need them now and my degeneration and other complications I have are only expected to get worse.\n\nI am not sure what I expect from a response from this reply, but you seem to fit the profile of people I am interested in in regards to my questions.

However, I have many a time had a ~150mg/day oxy habit an just grabbed one sub strip and did a taper something like 2mg, 2mg, 1mg, 1mg, .5mg, .5mg, .5mg, .25mg, .25mg and then been off. So as the example implies, I would start with an 8mg sub strip and cut in in the aforementioned doses the best I could. I did it a few times and it worked very well for me. A lot of people don't realize how strong bupe is and how little you need to just stay well.

Also help with determining if a blue I got was pressed", "1_Text": "Not too knowledgeable in the pressie department, but what you described as thinking the pressed blue that took an hour to hit was most definitely not H. Now I have only done H enough times I could count on my fingers. This was during a time before Pain Management when I was self medicating and pills were getting waaayy to expensive. So I talked to my pill connect and he also slung H. He said he had reeaaalllyy potent and clean H but he also told me straight up that he cuts it with lab grade lactose anhydrous for his customers switching from blues to H because the straight H he has was quite stronger weight to weight compared to the blues. So for me, he cut it so that it was very similar in potency compared to a 30. So what I did my first time trying H was I got half the amount of 30s I would normally get (10 for $280 instead of 20 for $560) and he said the H was $75 a gram and it should be equal to like 12 blues. I was like 12 BLUES!?!? so your telling me $75 OF H IS EQUAL TO $336 OF BLUES!?!? It was all over for me after that. I stared getting like 5 blues then some H. Soon it was just H. What can I say, it was just waaayyy cheaper. Luckily for me the connect moved and I eventually got excepted into Pain Management,  but that's another story.\n\nAnyway, so for that, I can speak of the comparison between oxy and H and there is a reason they called oxy the hillbilly heroin. It was almost identical in feeling.  The only thing that was really different for me was that H hit me sooner after snorting it than the oxy would and it seemed to, not really sure how to describe it, but it just seemed to do it's job/purpose better. The only reason I can think this is is because the morphine molecule in H is dicetlated which makes it more liped soluble which allows more of it to cross the blood brain barrier faster before any of the drug can start to metabolize. Other than those minute and peculiar diferences, it is generally very simular.\n\nBut going back to your thought that because the fake 30 you had took an hour to kick in tells me that it was anything but H.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwmd4f9": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Doc finally gave me some pandas \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29.", "1_Text": "For the opana, I take 15mg er twice a day and I also have oxy 15mg ir 4x day.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwntsdd": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Grey dope", "1_Text": "Upload to imgur is the safest.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dws7xga": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Variety packs are always nice \ud83d\ude0e", "1_Text": "Nice pick up!\n\nNot sure if it's the lighting/camera quality, but the color on some of those pills seem to be off a little.
