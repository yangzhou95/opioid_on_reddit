I'm generally a shy kinda guy who doesn't speak his mind, but when I was on subs I let whatever I was thinking fly, sometime I should've probably bitten my tongue.

I've been clean for 2 years. I lurk this subreddit to offer advice and/or help people. Believe me, I understand the disease. Funny thing is, I quit smoking cigarettes for 7 years, but as soon as I got to rehab to get clean, I started smoking again. I guess my brain is always going to want those pleasure centers rewarded, whether it's opiates or nicotine, lol! For no I'll take the cigs over an opiate habit tho, plan on quitting them again soon. \nAnyhow.... best of luck. I hate to sound clich\u00e9, but you'll get clean if you really want it! After nearly 20 years, I realized I wasn't getting any younger and was just sick of the life. Besides the cigarettes (it really pisses me off I started again after 7 years quit!) life is so much better on the other side of that shit. \nBelieve me, I still think of getting high.
