You can too. GET BACK ON SUBS\n\nI have a some what similar story. \n\nI had a great job, some where i should have had no chance getting in, but I was able to talk my way into it. I worked my ass of there and rose quick within 2 years I had a $10 pay increase and became a foreman. I had 4 years clean, and life was great. I was so proud of myself being able to give my family a good life and future. \n\nThen I fell off a ladder. I fractured my knee and ruptured and tore some tendons. \n\nThe second part is a very long story but as many can predict at some point the pills stop being enough and I went back to H.\n\nI was able to get on subs a few months ago. I am still on work restrictions so I couldn't get back in the trades. But finding a different job was np. I go there 8-9 hrs a day and work as hard as I did at my last job. \n\nIm less than 3 months clean. I'm back in shape, habe a decent job, and most importantly, everything is good again with my family. \n\nWhere I live there is a lot of fent to and I have lost 3 once very close friends just since I've been clean. Which lead to big busts  in  my home town and more friends going back to prison for I'm sure will be looking sentences. \n\nGo back on subs, go get a new job, any job. Just something to keep you busy and pay bills. \n\nIm no expert but I wouldn't think what you do isn't  that common. With time I'm sure you'll have no problem getting in some where else, or maybe back to your old shop. \n\nMost importantly get back on the subs asap!
