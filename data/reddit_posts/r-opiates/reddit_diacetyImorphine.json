They always throw us suggestions but when we try it, its not THAT good. The corner/set I go to always ended up being better/stronger. Idk if its because they have less money so their tolerance is lower compared to us who spend ~1k a week on dope which allows our tolerance to shoot through the roof. Our reasoning was homeless junkies have less money so they find the best dope to make the most out of their money. But my boyfriend said I was right after trying multiple suggestions, sometimes you already have the best product around and don't need to look around.\nA lot of homeless people are really cool tho, most of the time they would point us in the right direction if our block is shut down due to cops or strike force without asking for a bag of dope or anything.

I started MMT at age 18, have been on and off methadone for 5 years. I'm a 23 year old female, started using at 15 years old. \n\n\nI'm lucky I had my dad to support my decisions and be there for me. Most parents don't understand the medical aspect of MMT & write it off as a legal replacement for heroin. The only thing I'm worried about is did he try other ways to get off opioids? Whether that's rehab, detox, suboxone/subutex, etc. My concern is you guys may have jumped into MMT too soon without exhausting all other options. MMT is used as a last resort when all else fails. That's why they usually require you to be physically addictedm (not RECREATIONAL use) for at least 2 years, even then, they don't like to let people start MMT unless they were abusing IV heroin or stronger opioids. Most people still snorting heroin or using oxycodone have a relatively mild withdrawal or if they haven't been physically addicted for 2years+, making it worse for them to get on methadone because they don't need to resort to long term treatment with a strong opioid (when they haven't been addicted for long or only using weaker opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone, etc). Some people find methadone is harder to get off, and on top of that he is still young & his brain hasn't fully devoloped so methadone may cause some health effects (such as prolonged QT interval increasing risk of heart arrhythmia).", "2_Subreddit": "Methadone"}], "duszm2t": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Are open air markets a thing near you? How do they run them?", "1_Text": "I live in the Northeast coast US by a major open air market (actually I live near 2 major cities with open air markets). I refuse to get my dope from anywhere else.\n\n\nThe way it works is there are blocks in certain large areas of the city with sets selling their product. The dope comes in stamped bags which is their \"brand\". At the sets, there are lookouts (who watch for the cops), singles (sell single bags), caseworkers (sell bundles/larger amounts), block manager (rarely/if ever is out there, the ones who bring the supply to the set), above that the boss who runs the block/set. They have 1 or 2 stash houses within a couple blocks so the block manager doesn't have to walk far to get the product/drop it off. Usually people start at the bottom of the chain of command & work their way up to higher responsibility (I have a phone connect I met when I copped on the block. He was doing singles sales at the time, in the 5 months I've known him he worked his way up to being the block manager & being the one who brings the bricks of dope to the block for them to sell & its awesome because he has access to the stash house so he's never not had dope when I call).\n\n\nNew blocks give out samples to attract potential customers & get the word out about their stamp/brand. Sets/blocks shout the name of their stamp as you walk by, along with other products they sell there like weed, coke, crack, k2, sometimes pcp, etc. there's SO many sets, sometimes 3 different ones on the same block right next to each other. compiled a list just to see & I think theres 50-100 sets total in our area - if not more. some blocks sell the same dope in 3 different corners with 3 different names, meaning they all have the same owner & product. I love it because I can always get dope 24/7, no need to call anyone you just have to know what area to go to. And the competition between so many blocks makes it so they have to have good product or their set/business will fail quickly. \n\n\n*lots* of people living & shooting up in abandos (abanadoned rowhomes) as well as homeless people living on the street in tents & users **panhandling everywhere!**\n\nalso this is the hood so lots of wandering sketchy people & cops (bike cops, strike force, walking cops). \n\nmost people (like me & my boyfriend) park up near the block they wanna go to & walk a few minutes because you're more likely to get pulled over driving. but most junkies here don't have cars & resort to public transportation.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "duxh8k3": [{"0_Comment Submission": "1g Raw Afghan #4 Perks of being connected to the brick man", "1_Text": "Mexico actually now supplies most of the heroin in the US.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "duxh8w1": [{"0_Comment Submission": "1g Raw Afghan #4 Perks of being connected to the brick man", "1_Text": "Mexico actually now supplies most of the heroin in the US.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dv5bg7k": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Got my take home today", "1_Text": "Thats crazy to me.
