Albedo keeps reminding the readers that she is forced to love him, and despite her being happy about it, it\u2019s not a good thing to mention. Many people talk about necrophilia, but I have yet to see Shalltear interested in an undead skeleton that\u2019s not Ainz, and she\u2019s seen different types of them, so I wouldn\u2019t exactly say it\u2019s her number 1 fetish. Plus Shalltear is badass. It\u2019s more satisfying to see her melt for Ainz (even for his voice), and then see how much she enjoys to cause pain to other creatures. Plus she has to deal with the almost always right next to Ainz overseer Albedo.

It\u2019s not because he\u2019s undead, a skeleton, or whatever, because otherwise she would say she loves them all and would want to marry countless people instead of just one. The words that the Japanese author uses to describe her love for him are certainly romantic as well, the exact same as Albedo\u2019s, so there shouldn\u2019t be any doubts about that.
