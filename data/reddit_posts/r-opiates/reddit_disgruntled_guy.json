In the early 1990s, the police flew their helicopters around the black neighbords either in search of crime or as an excessive measure in an arrest. Ice Cube's song \"Ghetto Bird\" clearly displays the sentiments of african-americans. They felt slighted and violated because they were being targeted.\"\n\n[- Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ghetto%20Bird)\n\nThis area is 70% finished but I wanted to do this screenshot anyway, only problem is I don't think there's a way for me to dictate where police helicopters decide to go, so upon seeing the opportunity I took advantage. Might not be possible later. If anyone has advice, that would be great.\n\nI don't wanna show off too much because I've been building up this idea for around two years now, but you're looking a lot of design cues and inspiration taken from South Los Angeles - particularly Watts, with the housing project in the bottom left based on Jordan Downs (but still a WIP).
