It\u2019s really not comparable to oxycodone at all, I have no clue why it\u2019s a thing going around here. My oxycodone tolerance must be so high that kratom has really no effect on me. It only dulls my brain for a bit, which is different from opiates that send your brain a rush of euphoria. \n\nFor someone that\u2019s an opioid naive, kratom can be nice. It does not produce the unique effects of oxycodone like many people think, but hey. Give it a try.
