Unless you have the option to weigh your dope and test it out before you buy it, you could be getting anything. (Especially depending on your location!

I dragged my feet and said I couldn't pee and since I had an appointment I got the hell out of there and was able to get a friend to piss for me. I was even fortunate enough to find someone to piss for me that was clean with the exception of suboxone, which I had a script for. \nAnyways, I successfully get the pee and have it in a bottle up inside me to keep it at the right temperature. I get back to the house and learn that Oxford house protocol says I have to pee in front of two of my housemates... Okay, so I get in the bathroom and have to struggle and strain to get this bottle of pee opened and get the pee in the cup. Eventually I get enough of it out to test. I hand over the cup and realize that I still have to get up off the toilet and get my pants up in front of these women but the bottle is basically falling out of me at this point because I had to squeeze it so hard to get the pee out. After a few awkward moments spent getting assisted, I manage to stand up without losing the bottle *and* I successfully pass the test!\nFinally able to relax, I go back downstairs and take the bottle out so I can relax. I had taken a couple Valium as a reward for a job well done and then fell asleep reading. Two hours later, I was rudely awakened and forced to take another UA. Sadly, I was not so lucky this time... I couldn't pull my shenanigans again because I wasn't allowed out of anyone's sight until I peed again.  Needless to say, that was my last day living in Oxford. I never failed the UA because I refused to take a second one... I left on my own free will that night, claiming that I felt like I was being picked on or something like that.\n\nSorry for the long/random story, guys!
