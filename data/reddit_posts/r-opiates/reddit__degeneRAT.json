I wish mine would apologize to me.. cuhs then that would mean that he knows that he was tripping on me.. but I feel like it's gonna be a long time before I get any form of apology from him. He's in denial of all his flaws.. I don't know what it is, but I feel like he denies his wrongdoings because if he denies it, then he'll never have to face it and do something about it.. it fucking sucks. I want him to just man the fuck up! Take some goddamn responsibility for his actions.. after two years of being with him, I realize there's really nothing that I can do about everything I have a problem with in him.. all I can do is leave him and hope that one day he realizes how stupid he was and that I actually did treat him to the best of my ability.. I'm so glad that someone can relate.. thank you for sharing and reading.. really! It means a lot... I don't have anyone to talk to about.. basically anything.. it sucks to hear that he was the one to give you your first hit.. I'm ashamed to admit that I was the one to introduce this substance to him.. he's worse off than me in his addiction. And his family (rightfully) hates my fucking guts. I know that I should leave him.. everything that's happened and continues to happen proves to me that he and I were just not meant to be.. at least not now.. and it fucking breaks my heart man.
