I spent a lot of time on 4chan a decade ago. It was a little disturbing back then with pics of beastiality, cp, retard rape etc. As someone who thinks that people are generally selfish, jealous, ego driven garbage I've never been so disappointed in humanity as I was after looking at /pol/ tonight. Obviously they're pro net neutrality because it's just a trump circle jerk in there now. \n\nIt's obvious to me that trump and the internet will be the doom of humankind. Before retards kept to themselves but now these ideas spread like viruses. Each side now chooses their own facts and separation from reality will only grow stronger. It's undeniable that most people are fucking stupid and now these same people decide for themselves what's true. And they do that by reading the news they want to hear and the only time they are suspicious is if facebook or newrepublicfreedom.tv tells them something they don't want to believe. Soon there will be no staple reputable news organizations and the minor integrity and accountability that's left will be gone. Civilization cannot continue when everything it doesn't want to believe is fake news. \n\nIt is so fucking mind boggling to me that people can't see how full of shit he is.", "2_Subreddit": "AdviceAnimals"}], "dqooz09": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Event Thread:UFC 218: HOLLOWAY VS.
