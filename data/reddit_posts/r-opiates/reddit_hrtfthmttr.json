Oh right, Republican judge appointments that couldn't give a shit about corporate abuse.\n\n* Medicine: soaring education debt generates the requirement for obscene salaries as a doctor, increasing inflationary pressure on medical procedure costs. I wonder who has been defunding public education for decades? Oh right.

I'll give you an example:\n\nIn my town, they imposed a tax on soda with sugar in it. The point was two-fold: reduce consumption of sugar for public health reasons, and expand funding of education and healthy food stamp programs for the poor.\n\n Beverage industry went bananas, said it would cost tons of jobs. Turns out that cost to produce a can of Coke--labor included--is close to 15 cents. Most of that is transporting the coke from manufacture to stores, and most of those jobs are Union.\n\nThe truth is, they are making $.75 a can, minimum, pure profit. So what happened? They increased prices *on diet products that weren't even taxed*. They did this because they knew that raising the price of a can by $.25 means nothing to most people, and a differential between diet and non was irrational. They've laid off zero people. They didn't even need to add the tax to their products, given the absurd profit a can produces.\n\nThe point is that whatever tradeoffs they whined about were never real.
