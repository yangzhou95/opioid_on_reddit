Back when I first started using (like 15 years ago, then I got clean for 7 years and have been using again for about 9 months) the shit was much cleaner. Now it's all garbage. I live in Utah and everything is so stepped on by the time it gets here you have to do so much more than you should in order to feel it. Ive even seen some shit that was so dirty you couldn't get it to draw up into a needle like it just immediately clogged every time- no way I'm putting that in my body it would cause some sort of crazy blockage in my veins and I would explode or something. It's made me consider trying out the DNM or going out of state to hook up just to try and get cleaner stuff. You would think that whoever is cutting the shit would at least use something water soluble or nontoxic enough that one missed shot wouldn't be such an issue, your body should be able to eventually absorb and get rid of a missed shot.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "ds66a85": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Abcesses/infections", "1_Text": "Look guys I'm not using dirty works or anything like that it's all clean new spoons new rigs everything. I'm not an idiot, I do the best I can. But if I ever do miss lately it seems to get infected almost immediately idk if its the cut of the dope or what. I've talked to my doc at length about draining abcesses at home and when it's acceptable and when I have to come in. If it ever spreads or won't come up to the surface after 2 nights with heat and prid or if it ever starts to have other side effects like feeling woozy and shit I know I need to go to the doc and I do. I'm just not going to go when he is going to do the same thing I will do at home. I have all the same supplies as he does, I've done it plenty of times before, and it doesn't cost me 150 bucks to see myself. Like I appreciate you all telling me how stupid I am for not running to the doc but let's be real I'm obviously an addict, so I'm not flush with cash all the time. I also know that if I go in he will put me on antibiotics and if we do that too often then when God forbid something really bad happens the antibiotics won't work. Plus it's not like there is no time window here. I give it 2 days to come up and then I Lance and drain it. Usually that day or the next day the weird black shit comes out (depending on size) and it immediately starts to heal up. If it didn't start to get better once I relieved the pressure and started getting the infection out, then I would know I need to go to the doc. I know it's all pretty gross and it doesn't make me society's most upstanding citizen but I am an addict I didn't think I would receive so much judgement here", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "ds66ew8": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Tan afghan ECP, tested fent free.
