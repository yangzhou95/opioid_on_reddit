It is so so SO much more than that.  It is NOT a religious place. If you've had one bad experience with one group, go to a different group or meeting. They're all a little different but the goal is the same...sobriety. \n\nPlease let me know if you felt judged or you were specifically alienated because of the higher power issue and you not believing in God.

Lol. I've been court ordered to treatment more than once, I've been forced by family into treatment more than once, and  I went voluntarily several times. In my opinion, treatment will finally work when you're ready. No body can tell you when that is; even the threat of prison looming over my head, being on probation, losing family, none of these things were enough to stop me from using. One day, it finally hit me. I was ready to quit. I was tired of the life. My final jail term and then last inpatient rehab was in 2013. After dozens of tries and forced trips, I was finally ready. Been clean & sober since 2013 but it took years of trying to get clean for it to actually stick. Best of luck. One love.

I will repeat, \" The ONLY requirement for membership is a DESIRE to stop using.\" You don't have to be clean to be in NA. Anyone that tells you different is ignorant and flat out wrong. If you're on methadone maintenance and truly trying to work that program and eventually taper yourself off, then they should have nothing but love and support for you. \nThe argument can be made that yes technically you aren't \"clean\" because you have opiates in your system. However, no one should be judging you for that or telling you that you don't belong. \nAs long as you are working the program, not abusing the methadone, and have a desire to be clean then you are absolutely welcome at ALL meetings. Some old timers and even young people that get on their high horse because they have a little sobriety under their belts may be judging or have an opinion on whether you are clean. Quite frankly, it's none of their business. Find the people that understand, be honest and work your own program. Please never give up on NA/AA. It really can be a wonderful tool. It saved my life the firat 2 years of my sobriety.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwuufa7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Opinions about NA/AA", "1_Text": "Are you basing this off of one bad experience?

I absolutely admit that SOME people in SOME groups/meetings can judge or say one isn't clean because of methadone maintenance or sub maintenance. However, it's like anything else, we have to take personal responsibility and that includes in our recovery. We have to find what works for us. If you don't like one meeting, go to a different one. If you feel judged, take a look at yourself and see what you can do on your side of things. Sometimes all it takes is explaining your story and a sincere desire to be clean. I can tell you with absolute certainty, that not ALL meetings and groups feel negative toward methadone maintenance. Not ALL of us have the same opinions.

The first 2 years of my sobriety NA was essential to me because I had no one else. I had no where else to turn. I had lost everything and burned every possible bridge. It was a place to go (meetings) sometimes a few a day, there were people that I could relate to and most importantly it was a place I was accepted. I needed to be around people that were going through what I was, I needed to feel like I belonged somewhere because I literally had nothing else. When I finally got sober, I was so broken and so ashamed that NA was the ONLY place I was fully accepted. People understood me. People wanted to talk to me. I could share my story and people understood. It also helped with my severe anxiety. I tried to stay busy by going to meetings and getting involved with groups and functions and service work. It gave me a purpose. \n\nThe longer I've been clean and sober though, I find I don't need it as much as I did in the beginning. I am still connected to NA but 5 years into sobriety and a shit ton of hard work, its not ALL I have anymore. Anyway, I've rambled enough. I'm sorry.
