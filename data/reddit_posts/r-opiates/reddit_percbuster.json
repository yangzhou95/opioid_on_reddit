Was just venting really.  No one close to me knows about my addiction but I've been clean for a long while now from a 4g a day habit.  Longest I've ever been since I started doing dope.  Feels good to have an outlet even if it's to internet strangers.  Getting clean and staying clean is the hardest thing I've ever done.

I've tried many times and failed but this is by far my longest run so far clean.  I feel good this time too, different than any other time I've gotten clean. \n\nAll good advice you have.  I appreciate you not coming off preachy, I can tell you have a deeper understanding of this than most.  \n\nSo I might as well tell you some of my backstory.  Like most I started this addiction with painkillers.  10/325 Norco to be specific.  I had what felt like an endless supply of these things from an employee of mine who got prescribed a ton but didn't take them.  Over the course of a year I started taking more and more until I was popping/snorting 10-15 of them a day.  That endless supply I thought I had wasn't enough as my tolerance built up.  I realized I had a problem and told my wife.  She was very supportive and took care of me while I detoxed.  Of course after getting clean I thought I could handle it and started taking them again.  Of course I got back into trouble with them.  I couldn't imagine going back to my wife and saying I fucked up again.  I had this bright idea of using heroin to wean off Percocet!!! Lol yes in hindsight what a fucking moron I was right.  Of course the heroin use spiraled into a 4g a day habit intranasally and I was super fucked.  I knew I had to get off but it was always ok as soon as (insert important event) is over I'll get clean.  Well, there's always something going on with a wife 2 kids and a large family so I kept putting it off.  Finally in January I had some time off and got the 'flu'.  Jumped cold turkey off 4gs a day.  Wow that was painful.  After a few weeks I couldn't take it and caved.  After expressing to my dgirl I wanted to get clean again she got me some 8mg subutex and I did a quick taper to get off.  That was much more pleasant than cold turkey I must say.  I've been clean since.  No more Subutex either.\n\nPoint being my wife was supportive when I told her I had a pill problem so she probably would be the same telling her about my heroin habit.  It's so shameful though.  I know I won't be taking this secret to the grave and it's just a matter of time before she learns the truth.  I really want to get more clean time under my belt so this is a distant memory when I tell her.  We shall see where this path leads tho, I am known for making spontaneous decisions so I'll leave it at that.", "2_Subreddit": "OpiatesRecovery"}], "dwrkxf1": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Today\u2019s pickup (;", "1_Text": "I was getting bricks (5 of those buns) for $175 but I was buying 10 at a time.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwrlk1k": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Flying to Pakistan shitpost", "1_Text": "Dude don't get caught you don't want to be in a Pakistani jail holy shit", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwrwjdf": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Today\u2019s pickup (;", "1_Text": "shit man.. bitch was trying to sell em to me for $250 and I wouldnt do it.  was my one and only plug and she was reliable as fuck and delivered to me too so fuck it.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwswwc9": [{"0_Comment Submission": "opiates n kpop", "1_Text": "Absolutely not", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwtijec": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Kinda Planning a Relapse..
