I have no idea why. She was quiet and never bothered anyone ever. She eventually changed schools. The same year she switched to the other school she was out selling Girl Scout cookies and was hit and killed by a drunk driver. I never even thought about how I was a piece of shit bully until she had died and it was too late. They day I found out I cried for a week and vowed to never be unkind to another soul again. Some on my friends would still make jokes about her haunting the school and shit after she died.  I stopped talking to them. In an ironic twist my papa died 8 years later and her headstone is right next to his. I talk to her every time  I visit him. I know I can never make up for what I did. She died at 14 and was tormented her short life for no reason. I'm disgusted by myself when I think about it.
