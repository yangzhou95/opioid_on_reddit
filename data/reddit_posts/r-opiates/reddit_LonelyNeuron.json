It just has a very low oral bioavailability (something like 2%) but when you consider that you're taking 20mg of naloxone that's still 0.4mg going into your bloodstream. Which is a ton of naloxone, that's more than what they give you during a typical overdose! I hate Targin sooo much. For me that's the only truly non-abusable version of oxy out there.
