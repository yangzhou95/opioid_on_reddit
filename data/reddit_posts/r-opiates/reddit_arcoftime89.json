Still super thankful like you said sence it could always be worse.  \n\nI believe they used two different yields or batches of seeds to fill the 9/14s, maybe even three. It seems they were decent when they first hit with a few unicorn bags here and there. But then there was those really small seeds with just a ton of red that you could see better once they are mixed with water, usually there are some red floaters but these had atleast a quarter inch of them on top, wash was dark but lacked bitterness.

Even the different pod. vendors i order from have way less potent pods during winter then they do in summer or fall. Last year sn had 2-4/10 rated bags in general from what I remember from around late December to until the .5er bags came out in may I think. Things gradually picked up. This last year was not so hot tho as the previous  two years were better imo. The plants stress levels react differently to heat and cold. The more stress the plant takes too, the more alkaloids it will make.
