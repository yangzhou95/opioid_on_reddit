I say young because some of the posts I have read seem so immature or ignorant to the point that there is no way that they'd still be alive if they were an experienced user with any long term habit.  I've been on this sub for probably about 3+ years (different handles) and I've definitely seen a decrease in quality.  Now I understand why different subs are getting banned. Long gone are the days of the \"voldermort\" sub, morbo stories, and turning Reddit friends into IRL friends.  Not trying to sound like some r/opiates old head OG guy, but just missing some of the older days of the subreddit. That being said, if anyone can contact morbo, any way we can get some more stories?", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwafc3r": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Getting off probation in 2 weeks.
