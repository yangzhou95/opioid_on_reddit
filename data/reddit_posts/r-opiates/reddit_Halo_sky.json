I would shoot my meds into my dialysis fistula. I ended up giving myself an infection in my heart valve and had to have open heart surgery to replace the damaged valve.

It took **eight** years to convince the transplant people that I was clean and following all my doctors orders to the letter before they put me back on the list. \n\nToday, my husband keeps my meds locked in a safe and he doles them out on a daily basis.
