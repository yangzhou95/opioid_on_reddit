You only have to see the doc once every month or two, you can fill your script allmat once and you're done. It's cheaper too. Methadone can only be prescribed for pain to be given a months supply right off the bat and a lot.of docs dont even bother with it. At the clinic you have to jump through hoops, piss in a cup all the time deal with people hounding you for money cause they are short for their dose, waiting in line every morning gets real old too.
