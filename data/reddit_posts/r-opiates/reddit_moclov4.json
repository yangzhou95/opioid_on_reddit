The great thing about UCSB is that there's something going on pretty much every single night of the week, so you won't feel like you missed out on much if it's a normal week and you have to study or do some project or something over the weekend instead of going out and partying; you have the rest of the week to do that. it's great how you didn't have to be in Greek life to have a social life; but IMO if you can handle it, it's pretty awesome to have a good balance between the two, it doesn't just have to be one or the other. I had great friends in the Greek system and just as many great friends outside of it; that's something I feel that you may miss out on entirely at SD if you choose not to go the Greek life route; all your friends most likely won't be in the Greek system, whereas at UCSB it's fairly easy and common to have friends/social lives equally in both.", "2_Subreddit": "UCSantaBarbara"}], "dwqpn6d": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Freshman advice and party etiquette", "1_Text": "\"don't look or act like a freshman\"\n\nOP, heed this advice - during the FIRST weekend especially, freshmen will venture out into Isla Vista in GROUPS. this is the telltale sign of freshmeat (uhh I mean Freshmen) and you will most likely get water balloons thrown at you. when I say groups, I mean like an entire residence hall's worth just banding together and walking up and down DP; there aren't too many other characteristics that I'd attribute to freshmen alone", "2_Subreddit": "UCSantaBarbara"}], "dwqqb1h": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What is your Reddit \"golden rule\"?", "1_Text": "of course there is the incredible option of: scrolling past walls of text and looking for the \"TL;DR\" at the bottom before actually reading the wall of text", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dwqrdrl": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What is your Reddit \"golden rule\"?", "1_Text": "ah, you mean with Reddit's not-crappy-at-all search \"feature\"?", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dwqrg9h": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What is your Reddit \"golden rule\"?", "1_Text": "yeah what about Nickelback?", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dwr483e": [{"0_Comment Submission": "The Psychopathology of Long-Term Addiction and Cessation.", "1_Text": "don't mind them, reading comprehension is hard for some people ...", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwrzt9i": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What's your favorite \"make a pot on Sunday and eat it all week\" meal?", "1_Text": "2am chili, anyone?!", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dwtewg3": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Freshman advice and party etiquette", "1_Text": "I'm not disagreeing with you at all, but in my experience freshmen are the only ones that walk around IV in huge groups, for the first quarter or so at least. you might see a transfer or grad student with the sweatshirts or something but you'll never see them roaming about in what basically is a sign that screams, \"throw water balloons at us!\" \n\nof course, I graduated in '11 so things might have changed since then", "2_Subreddit": "UCSantaBarbara"}], "dwuxxrn": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What's a reference that any fan will immediately recognize, but others won't?", "1_Text": "cooking books is redeemable?
