The third reich had fought a lot of disgusting bloody wars, perpetuated genocides and killed a lot of civilians, in Dresden the German people got a taste of the violence they were spreading abroad. \n\nIn the same way the Birmingham bombings were just a small taste of what the Brits were doing and had done to Ireland and indeed most of the third world.\n\nDo I think German, British, Russian or American civilians ever deserve to get killed? Of course not. But you don't get to act sanctimonious about 21 killed when the British empire has done what it has done.\n\n\nPS: This IRA bombing seems as it might have been a mistake, perhaps it was to be one of those were the civilians were forewarned.
