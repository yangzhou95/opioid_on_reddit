It came with a Nvidia 1070, got lucky buying that before GPU prices doubled. \n\nI originally bought the PC for gaming, however I got interested in the world of Cryptos and Vertcoin was one of the first and best coins I came across for people like gamers running on at least 1 GPU. \n\nI've been mining Vertcoin since early December whenever I'm not gaming or not home, or just surfing the web. I've tried ethereum and was not convinced due to the difficulty. \n\nI'll continue mining vertcoin because ant miners are unable to touch this coin. For those using P2P/local nodes to mine, check out vertcoin easymine website. On that, I mine and receive payouts for vertcoin and another altcoin called Unitus simultaneously.
