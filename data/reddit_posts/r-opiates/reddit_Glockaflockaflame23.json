I truly only like Indica strains, as most Sativas make me super anxious and paranoid.  Speaking of which, the most paranoid i\u2019ve ever gotten was probably my 3rd time ever smoking.  I had 4 grams of lemon haze and rolled it into a backwood, got cocky and smoked the whole blunt by myself.  Obviously i got way to high really fast and almost immediately started to feel nauseas.  I felt my heart beating extremely fast, my vision started to get blurry and soon after i couldn\u2019t see anything but green and red haze, kinda looked like when your TV is staticky, and was sweating profusely.  I eventually just closed my eyes and laid on the ground for a while until i felt ok to open them again.  This felt like 30 mins but was realistically only 5 maybe.  I then realized i had a panic attack and started feeling better.
