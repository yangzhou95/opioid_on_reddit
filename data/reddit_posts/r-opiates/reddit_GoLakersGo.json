That\u2019s because at the time that was my perspective, then years later a couple G a day IV H withdrawals showed me what REAL withdrawals are!\n\nAnyways to give some advice, get some comfort meds! Suboxone/methadone will do wonders! However don\u2019t get addicted to these. Quick taper and stop! What\u2019s nice about pills is you know exactly what your getting and the dose so a good taper schedule with your blues is possible if you have good self control.\n\nOther comfort meds that help me tremendously are benzos, clonodine, and maybe gabapentine. Never tried Keaton but I hear GREAT things about that on this sub. Then there are OTC meds such as weed, whiskey, and Imodium, that will help you as well! Be careful with Imodium in high doses it is toxic to heart!\n\nFinally my advice will he know the withdrawals won\u2019t be forever. It can and will get so so so much worse if you continue. Stopping is easy but STAYING sober is extremely difficult! Stop before you get to deep. If you can\u2019t stop by yourself go to your parents for help!

I happened to be in the garage when the warrant was served. Long story short I was in handcuffs for 2 hours while they did the search. 4/5 people in the house got arrested. 3 of us in the garage got off. Only thing in the garage was a little dope, a scale, paraphernalia etc. they didnt find somehow. \n\n-Shop lifiting at walmart with a crew. I go to the car to drop off some goods as the police arrive/loss prevention catch the rest of the crew. I somehow make my way out of the parking lot while being searched for. As Im about off the property I get spotlighted, luckily I had changed out of my distinct jacked, put on a hat and glasses. He drives away. BOLO issued for me and the vehicle. I let the cops leave. They snatch up the other 2 of the crew. I sneak back to the car and make it home. That was kinda lucky cus there was 3g's of dope in the car and walking home wasnt an option. \n\n-Woken up to cops at the door staying in a diff garage. The guy who owned the place was on parole and got caught early morning breaking into cars, so cops show up to do a parole/probation search. There was a ton of shit in that garage. They ask me a few questions while im handcuffed. Im polite. They let me go.\n\n-Cant be to specific on the next 2: \n-Was working at a hotel. Would make keys to rooms while guests were away. Thefts are way up on the property...for some reason. Get caught in a room, luckily before I stole anything. Get fired, they cant prove I was responsible for rest of thefts, luckily no cameras on property. \n\n-Fraud check shit where 2/3 got arrested somehow I didnt. They both have felonies, they didnt roll/rat on me though, the girl was a good friend.\n\nNon Dope: Pulled over for expired tags. Had drankend a fith of corwn proceeding. Cop asks me questions about drinking I dont say/admit to anything. Initiates a sobriety test. Get to the 1st part with eyes following fingers. Know Im fucked. He says \"you just wasted 15minutes of both our time.\" Lets me go home with tag tickets.\n\n-Sleeping with my car. Get welfare checked. Had over an ounce of bud (big deal at the time) and a weapon. Had blazed it up recently so knew the car smelled. Cop asks to search the vehicle. \"Sir I respectfully do not consent to a search of my vehicle\"...\"Ok get out of here then.\"\n\nThere are a few more I CANNOT mention sorry. The one time I did get arrested was for expired registration on my vehicle. Got pulled over 4 times by the same cop. 1st time verbal warning, 2nd written, 3rd ticket and warning of arrest, 4th time arrested. Spent 3 hours in a cell before bailed out.

The best shelter I had was an unlocked broken down box truck at the local tortilla factory I would sneak into at night, and get out of early in the morning before the workers arrived. One morning I overslept and was caught by a young worker. Fortunately he was very nice, even called me back when he saw I had left my flashlight in the back, which was perhaps my 2nd most important item I had left after my sleeping bag! \n\nI didnt even have a tent! Some nights I could sneak into this wooden 4'x5' (I am 6'4\" btw for context) shack that once housed a water heater that was removed. A few nights in my search for shelter I would be so sick and desperate I would sleep literally on the front porch/floor mats of an unoccupied vacation rental. This was because this rentals porch was out of sight from the road and was close to the ONLY 24H supermarket/store within walking distance. \n\nThat market and the employees there I will forever be grateful for! It was a place where when I was literally on the verge of hypothermia I could go to at least get warm! I would sit in the little area where people during the day would sit and eat there sandwiches and various other items purchased from the deli, it even featured a gas powered fireplace! Some times I would be so sick and desperate I would fall asleep there (A BIG NO NO) but I was never once asked to leave. I would be so tired and cold some nights I would sneak into the bathroom and sleep sitting on the toilet. Those employees were saints! I would just sit there and read. I think the employees knew this was literally the only place many of the homeless had a chance to be in a warm place. The other homeless I only saw during daytime hours there. Most of my daytime hours were spent at the library when it was open. AGAIN SO THANKFUL FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES AS WELL! \n\nI feel bad because I would steal food from this market though from time to time, mostly just (I HATE that i say \"just\" theres no \"justifying\" what I did, stealing was stealing) a loaf of bread and some cold cuts I could slip into my jacket. My ONLY possessions were a sleeping bag and the 3-4 layers of clothes I had on my back, plus my lovely flashlight, a flip phone, and a small pocket knife, and of course a couple rigs that had been used A LOT and whatever other paraphernalia I would have on me.\n\nIt was a miserable experience. The lowest point of my life. I was sick most days, but not enough days in a row to get clean, a terrible cycle to be in. Anyways Im rambling so ill get to the point. I eventually confided in a friend, my best friend, the position and situation my life was in. He told me he would pick me up after work and take me to any restaurant I wanted! Of course I let him end up choosing, and we ate Pho and talked about my situation. \n\n\"PLEASE man please! You CANNOT tell my sister or my mom whats up. I swear man Im gunna get it together by myself. Im gunna get this sorted out, Im gunna find a job, get clean, and get MYSELF out of this situation, BY MYSELF! I can do this! It will DEVASTATE them if they know Im using again, it BREAKS their hearts!\" Man I was so delusional/crazy that I actually believed I could. Little did I know they already knew I was using again, just not to what extent or what my situation was. My mom said she knew for certain when in September she hadnt heard from me in 22 days. We are very close and talk often. They knew though it had to be me to ask them for help. An addict in most cases will not get clean unless they themselves want it. They cannot be asked by others to get clean. They were ready and just waiting for me to ask for the help. \n\nA long delicious dinner ends, my buddy gives me his prized beanie from the ski resort he worked at, and we part ways. I make him PROMISE one last time not to tell my family! Anyways my buddy mulls it over and yes of course he ends up calling little sis 2 days later and explains the situation Im in. He had to, and I am so glad he did. I was not angry in the slightest he did. I think deep down inside I knew he would tell them, that this was the start of me asking for help. This was also the 2nd time he had to alert them of my using. \n\nThe 1st time was about 2 years prior when I 1st tried H and had gotten addicted and spent over 65k. Went from 200ish pounds to 155 the day I was entered into detox. Remember Im 6'4\", so this was not a healthy weight for me. From 1st trying it on October 2nd, 14 to about 6 months later. I was addicted to it within the 1st 2 weeks of that 6 months....thats another long story, so I wont tell that one now.\n\nAnyways little sis calls me a day after finding out. They had decided they needed to confront me, the waiting was over! My situation was now a close to death one. They had to act. This was perhaps the most difficult phone conversation I ever had. I admit to her my situation and confirm my best friends story is indeed true. I beg for the help she offers and cannot stop crying or apologizing to her.  That night im in a motel room she puts me up in. The plan is being made for my evacuation of my once so cherished and loved and beautiful mountain town that has becoming my nightmare. They both live on the islands in the pacific so logistics are a bit difficult. \n\nThe next day the plan is set. Mom calls and this conversation is a lot less terrible than the one with sis. She did learn A LOT from the family sessions (little sis could not attend) at my 1st in patient 30 day rehab! She is cool, calm, and collected. She doesnt berate me, she doesnt tell me how I am literally shortening her life with the stress, worry, and grief I am causing her again. She knows I know this already anyways. I am very impressed, in fact I am shocked by the conversation. How the HELL was she able to remain so calm, and NOT break down crying on the phone I will never know. Man if I knew that conversation was going to be like that I would of called and asked for the help months earlier.\n\n Mama bear will fly out in a week to get my ass out of there. She will find a detox and a rehab in LA (my hometown and where my grandma lives) before she gets there. She has the flights and rental car all arraigned. Little sis sets me up for the entire week in the hotel. Mom wires me some money to STAY well and get some food (which of course just went to more heroin) because what I was doing for money was very very very bad. Things again I probably will never forgive myself for. Fortunately I NEVER physically hurt anyone. If I would of crossed that line I dont think I could live with myself. I NEVER did any sexual stuff for money, although that was just because of the lack of opportunity, not because I was unwilling. Hell if I was sick and offered $40 to suck a dick, I can almost guarantee I would have.  and I dont think I will EVER be able to forgive myself for my actions. She decided it was safer for me to have the $ rather than to be arrested or killed before she could get to me. Of course I exaggerated the daily total needed to just stay well, thats a natural for us junkie scumbag addicts ; ). She confides in me later that was perhaps the hardest thing she had to ever do in her life. Sending her 1st born money for heroin. Her brother died from an OD at 36. She wanted me in that room until she could get to me. Were her decisions the correct one? \n\nFast forward and the reunion is about to take place. She is getting close into town and calls me. The pre-arranged meeting spot was of course, the library! She knew where that was from when she used to go herself when she would visit! Again I am stunned at her demeanor, words, and matter-of-factness about the situation. She embraces her big baby boy. Again I am amazed she doesnt break down in front of me. Perhaps she is out of tears? This was nothing like the 1st time she found out I was using where I held her in my arms as she sobbed, and shaked uncontrollably in a state of absolute shock and grief. The EXACT same way she felt in my arms when I would try and comfort her after finding her on the floor after coming home from school after we lost dad 13 years earlier.\n\nWe get in the car for the long drive back to LA. She aks if I have enough for the ride so I wont start puking and shitting and entering sickness on the way down to detox! She is familiar with the sickness. Of course the junkie scumbag addict says \"You know what, it would probably be the safest bet to get more. Im running low.\" Of course I had enough to stay well. So we make a pit stop first for what will hopefully be my final score.\n\n(FUCK 10,000 WORDS LIMIT?! DIDNT KNOW THAT! PART 2 IN MY REPLY BELOW ABOUT SUBS!)", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dv3zjz7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "This is it, guys.", "1_Text": "******ENTER SUBOXONE! This part (and im so sorry, I will keep this short!) I was familar with it already both from a recreational standpoint and from my 1st rehab. 1st time was decided for a quick taper. Heck it was my 1st rehab and I was only smoking it! QUICK TAPER FOR THE NEW BOY! \n\nThis time it is decided I will be taking it for an un yet determined amount of time. It will be used as a maintenance medication. I am open to the concept. I had a GREAT sub doctor. I am prescribed 8mg a day. For me this was a great starter dose. I attend an intensive outpatient rehab program that will last around 6-8 months back in my hometown while staying with grandma! Mom will end up staying to after we find out a month into being there, grandma has stage 4 lung cancer that has spread to her brain. We become her caregivers a long with the wonderful HOSPICE nurses who visit every other day. She is able to stay and die at home in her own bed. Sorry I got off topic there. The one thing that correlates and that I am actually very proud of myself is the suboxone helped me to stave off the cravings of STEALING grandmas meds (you know the oral morphine sulfate HOSPICE gives) even though they are of course hidden from me. They were for a time until I saw mama accidentally reveal the stash spot! Still the suboxone keeps me sane enough to make the right decisions, even though I will admit the THOUGHTS and CRAVINGS occasionally do cross my mind! But not with the intensity they would have been without the subs. Without the subs im 95% sure I would have stolen as many doses of the morphine I thought I could get away with without causing grandma pain, and not getting caught. \n\nThe difficult thing with subs, it works differently for everybody!  Some like it, some dont. Some prefer methadone. Never tired methadone for maintenance, only for recreation so couldnt tell you about that.\n\nFor some it helps cravings GREATLY! For me it was great for the cravings, but like I said, I Would still get them from time to time. Some days, weeks, and months were bad and all I thought about was slamming that great and cheap LA fire I knew was around, and could easily obtain. But heck even if I did, I would of had to plan it out. Thats also a good benefit about subs! \n\nIF you take your morning dose, and decide that afternoon you want to say FUCK IT! FUCK IT ALL! 1 MORE TIME! 1 LAST TIME THAT CHEAP LA FIRE IS 15 MIN AWAY! I NEED TO REWARD MYSELF FOR HOW GOOD I AM DOING BEING SOBER! I NEED TO REWARD MYSELF FOR TAKING CARE OF A DYING OLD WOMEN WHO I DEARLY LOVE! ITS STRESSFUL WATCHING THE ONES YOU LOVE DIE BUT THEY RELY ON YOU FOR CARE SO THERE IS NO BREAK FROM IT! EVERYONE WOULD UNDERSTAND IF YOU GOT CAUGHT! LOOK WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH! FUCKING DO IT!!!!!! Is that the subs will BLOCK that HIGH in that moment you snapped! You would have to plan it out, purposefully miss a daily dose, to get high, and thats the theory, it will give you that time (at least for me) to come to your senses. \n\nAbout a year after first coming back home grandma passes and our obligations end. Mom has to get back to her husband in Hawaii who has grown feral again in her absence. My outpatient program ends, but what is to become of me? Mom offers me the shack in the back in the Volcano Forest. A Fucking lovely place. Ill get a job wherever I can, save up money, eventually get my own place. Live the island life brah. Of man THE ISLAND LIFE! I FUCKING LOVE IT! HAWAIIN SHIRTS! AHHH!!!!!!!\n\nHowever a miracle happens and I get offered a GREAT job out of state. Thats where I am at now. New state, with the BEST job (both financially, and rewarding) I have ever had. I am lying IN A BED!!!!! In a luxury ( I consider it luxury! Hardfuckingwood floors and granite countertops?!?! They have a trash valet?!) apartment.  I have furniture and possesions again? AN XBOX AND TV? WTF!!!!! \n\nI am overall happy again. I still have very rough days, weeks, months, but I still get by. I am still taking my suboxone, although I am now down to 1mg daily. That was my choice, I wasnt forced to that dose. I couldnt have done all of that without suboxone. It is an integral part of this puzzle called sobriety. \n\nI NEED to clarify though, I of course try and put effort into being clean as well. Its not like subs are the 1 and only thing you need to do. I am not a 12 stepper, but have nothing against it. But yea man, you need a plan. For me, subs have helped a lot. Sorry for the rant.

You can imagine what I did having a 60-120$ H habit and no source of income.\n\nLuckily I had health insurance through a parent, but add those costs up to for those who don\u2019t. Add the cost of incarceration of us addicts. Yeah I was a thief, I hurt people, I\u2019ll never forgive myself. If you haven\u2019t experienced a sincere heroin addiction and sickness you don\u2019t understand.

Hell I wish I NEVER got into H in the first place. When I first started using IV, one of my running partners would hit me. She was this cute girl who was a phlebotomist! I was very lucky.\n\nShe NEVER missed, and it was almost sexy in a way having her hit me. Whats unusual was she did not IV herself, she only smoked it. One day I asked her why she was willing and she said \"I know you will just try and do it yourself anyways, this way you wont fuck your stuff up!\" She was right about that. \n\nTypical story, told myself IV use saves me money, and Ill only do it once a week, and for awhile I did only IV once a week....and a couple months later my use had increased and that was all im doing.\n\nIts a good guide KPINN but I cant imagine a lot of people are willing to read a 130+ page document haha.
