As part of law enforcement training, you are taught how much of a drug you need in the test kit for it to test appropriately.

In addition as part of your training, you are taught what drugs look like by sight, smell, texture, etc...  So when you are reasonably confident that it is heroin for example, it doesn't do any harm to test it twice if you accidentally didn't put enough of the drug into the kit.
