Depending on how long, and how much you\u2019ve been using your DOC, you could do a buprenorphine taper (via a doctor in your area that is able to write the prescription) or go to a local methadone clinic with the intent of doing a taper. If you aren\u2019t in a stable place regarding your mental health issues, and fear that relapse is possible, you could always continue treatment with buprenorphine, or methadone, maintenance dosing, if needed. These options provide the least disruption to your personal and work life and your medical treatment is completely confidential. The alternative is to go to a detox center and come off your DOC with minimal medical intervention over the course of a few days (or attempt to wean off/use a DOC substitute, such as Kratom/go cold turkey at home but I was never successful with these methods, personally).

Definitely takes the edge off but isn\u2019t a cure all. Helped me to get through work though. My dose was 140 MG of Methadone (after coming off a 2.5g/day H habit and/or 300MG+/day Oxycodone habit) and I needed about 150 MG of the extended release DXM twice daily coupled with 15-30 MG doses of immediate release DXM every hour or two and about 20 MG of Loperamide twice daily to get through each day without my dose. I\u2019d throw in 600-800 MG of Ibuprofen twice daily for good measure. At night, 1 pill of a Magnesium supplement would help with the RLS. I\u2019m a 200 lbs 35 y/o male, if that helps somewhat. Sorry, if this isn\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for, but I\u2019ve never used Phenibut during WDs. Definitely be careful as both DXM and Loperamide can cause tachycardia and Loperamide alone is cardiotoxic. I\u2019m not sure of your health history so I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend following my regimen exactly as written.
