If need be make sure you give her pain medication as needed.  Second, make sure your pain meds, if any, are not accessible to her.

If she's constantly broke and/or looking for money. Unless you know where that money is going with your own eyes (if she says she needs it for clothes or books, make sure the amount she is asking for is damn near spot on to the cost of what she is looking to buy.\n\nSecond, pinned eyes.  This is an easy one to spot, if the black in her eyes is tiny, she is on something (not sure aside from opiates what else causes this)\n\nThird, if she randomly shows signs of withdrawal (runny nose, sweats, etc) then it goes away, and comes back and so on and so forth, then she could be using, then out of money or connects, then using, etc. \n\nHope this helps in some way", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwrzh3e": [{"0_Comment Submission": "My biggest fear", "1_Text": "If even one person avoids this addiction due to anything I tell anyone, anywhere, that's a win .
