Don't get me wrong there is some sort of feeling of being free (I guess freedom from having to make decisions) when you are told what to do with yourself and every decision made for you. Boot camp really was nice in that regard and was very meditative for me. I believe that's kinda the way the Soto school of Zen Buddhism operates for their monks. Although it might be Rinzai because I get the two confused but I think Rinzai is the one with koans and sudden enlightenment and all that jazz.
