For people who have never been addicts, it might not seem sensible or it might come off as glorifying drug abuse. Im not going to pretend that a lot of the users dont use it for that, but that is not its sole purpose. It provides a platform for people sharing not only an interest, but a problem, a very serious and widespread problem. Addicts need a voice and place to share without being judged or condemned.
