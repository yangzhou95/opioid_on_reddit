First of all, having taken as much as you did, the buprenorphine may still be bound to your receptor sites. I wouldn\u2019t expect it to stay there too much longer since you didn\u2019t use it long term, but it is definitely possible for it to take another couple of days to completely clear out. Second of all, buprenorphine is a very strong drug and may have therefore temporarily increased your tolerance to opioids. I do not believe that cross tolerance develops between bupe and oxy, but I\u2019m also not 100% sure. Either way after using buprenorphine recreationally, as strong as it is, it does make sense that a few days later you wouldn\u2019t feel much from the oxy. If you wait a few more days, things will likely go back to normal. \n\nAlso, by parachuting did you mean that you basically swallowed the suboxone? Because that doesn\u2019t work at all. Buprenorphine is not orally bioavailable. Or did you mean that you put it up your butt? \n\nThis is all pretty basic bupe knowledge and should have been available to you on any bupe forum.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwlvtkb": [{"0_Comment Submission": "We need to break through OP's!!!!", "1_Text": "It was definitely around in 2010, I remember the house I was in when I was doing this and I lived there before I turned 21, so mid to late 2010 or early 2011 at the latest. \n\nEdit: just googled.

I don\u2019t have my degree yet but I\u2019m a pharmacy student and everything that was said was just....no. That\u2019s not how any of this works. \n\n1. There is no evidence that short term recreational use of buprenorphine alters the receptor sites once the drug has fully cleared your system. Think about the implications of that, were it true. Would it be wise to release a drug to the public that can permanently alter ones brain chemistry in a few days? Especially one with abuse potential? \n\n2. Neither buprenorphine nor naloxone are really orally bioavailable, meaning that swallowing it would not affect you much at all. Naloxone is actually less orally bioavailable than buprenorphine is. \n\n3. Swallowing naloxone will not affect you at all, let alone coat your stomach. Your body will process it out without any pharmaceutical effects, and it will not alter your ability to \u201cbreak down\u201d oxycodone in the future.", "2_Subreddit": "opiates"}], "dwmsq61": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Used subs for the first time recreationally, need advice please...", "1_Text": "Hmm, I have never heard parachuting used in that sense before, but slang terms definitely vary from place to place. I have heard it used in the context of crushing pills, wrapping them in tp (hence, parachute) , and swallowing. I have also heard it in the context of shoving stuff up your popper :-). \n\nIf you do ever decide to do subs in the future, the best way to do it is to let them dissolve UNDER your tongue (sublingually) instead of on top. Certain drugs are absorbed more readily through the tissue under your tongue, and bupe is one of them. Letting it dissolve on top of your tongue may mean swallowing more of the drug than you absorb. And yes it tastes awful. I have always said suboxone tastes like tangerines that have rotted in the asshole of Satan. \n\nI don\u2019t personally believe that you need to do a full induction in order to experience the recreational effects of buprenorphine, but I do think that it is a unique drug that can be easily misunderstood. Unlike other opioids, less can be more with buprenorphine. When you take lower doses, you may actually experience more euphoria due to the production, absorption, an concentration of norbuprenorphine by your body. It also has a ceiling effect. There are only so many opioid receptors available in your brain. And buprenorphine has an extremely high binding affinity, meaning that it really sticks to those receptors. Once they are full, any additional buprenorphine will not bind. That is why buprenorphine is not considered a drug that leads to overdose, and why people may be telling you that taking 32 mgs was wasteful. \n\nI think waiting another few days or until next week to take any more oxy is wise. I also think that you need to take some of the comments people leave you with a grain of salt, because I have seen a lot of misinformation spread. Taking the amount of bupe that you did will not permanently alter your brain chemistry, like someone else said. There is no evidence of that , that I have ever seen. Swallowing naloxone also won\u2019t alter your ability to absorb oxycodone in the future. It is actually even less orally bioavailable than buprenorphine.
