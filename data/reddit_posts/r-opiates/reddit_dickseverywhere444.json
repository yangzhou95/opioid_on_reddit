I used to sell heroin, I've been clean for two years, but back then I was a kid who came from a middle class suburb and got my hands on an illegal obtained shot gun for $150. Also available were handguns and various rifles. Nothing was more than maybe $500 for something really nice. One handgun was about $80. I did not have to dig deep to find someone who knew someone selling guns. It was not difficult. And I can only imagine that by flat out banning them it will become easier, because gangs and cartels will only have more of a market to sell their weapons so there is more of an incentive to bring them in large amounts.", "2_Subreddit": "4chan"}], "dwy7vi7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Jose Makes a Good Point", "1_Text": "Or will just ask any drug addict where to buy one.", "2_Subreddit": "4chan"}], "dwy7xzi": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Jose Makes a Good Point", "1_Text": "Be Muslim, be in UK, make rape with everyone's wife, husband's go to jail for threatening to kill me.", "2_Subreddit": "4chan"}], "dwy83eu": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Jose Makes a Good Point", "1_Text": "And also in California anything \"spring assisted opening\" is illegal, and I definitely remember Being ID'd and turned down trying to buy a knife at 16", "2_Subreddit": "4chan"}], "dwy88vb": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Jose Makes a Good Point", "1_Text": "It's our body armor.", "2_Subreddit": "4chan"}], "dwy9ulh": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Road construction worker hit by car", "1_Text": "These puns wont stop until we hit bottom.", "2_Subreddit": "watchpeopledie"}], "dwyb1x3": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Happy George is SAD George...", "1_Text": "How high are you right now?", "2_Subreddit": "funny"}], "dwyb2yd": [{"0_Comment Submission": "My phone lock screen", "1_Text": "It's beautiful.", "2_Subreddit": "rickandmorty"}], "dwybtml": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Anon plays GTA IV", "1_Text": "Cold.\n\nAt least give the guy credit for his huge black dong if your gonna talk about her new dude like that.", "2_Subreddit": "4chan"}], "dwycrcm": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Happy George is SAD George...", "1_Text": "I do not believe it ;)", "2_Subreddit": "funny"}], "dwyd8p0": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Happy George is SAD George...", "1_Text": "Haha, thanks.", "2_Subreddit": "funny"}], "dwydg41": [{"0_Comment Submission": "What's the best 2 player games to play with a significant other?", "1_Text": "There's always gotta be that one detective tryna' brush the dust off a case!", "2_Subreddit": "AskReddit"}], "dwyed2r": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Oh No", "1_Text": "You only you only live once one time.\n\nShould be on a t-shirt.", "2_Subreddit": "rickandmorty"}], "dwyee1q": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Oh No", "1_Text": "Even your smiley is fucked up.", "2_Subreddit": "rickandmorty"}], "dwyeep7": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Oh No", "1_Text": "I cannot upvote this....but I can't downvote it either.", "2_Subreddit": "rickandmorty"}], "dwyepbr": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Oh No", "1_Text": "Including all the pedophiles in here!", "2_Subreddit": "rickandmorty"}], "dwyf32b": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Catch the greased-up deaf guy", "1_Text": "Dude is fast", "2_Subreddit": "WTF"}], "dwyf4hy": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Oh No", "1_Text": "<3 That's my jam.", "2_Subreddit": "rickandmorty"}], "dwyfb26": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Eurofighter explodes as it crashes into the water", "1_Text": "Good that he slapped the fuck out her right back.
