Just the reactions to the question show that it's engrained in the culture that *everyone* has  the right to say *anything*. May it be wrong, may it be disrespectful or may it be inciting violence or conflict. This is part of the reason your country is in the state it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n In Germany denying the holocaust is the equivalent of  a felony. Hate speech and lies that are meant to discredit a group because of their ethnicity, physical ability and all the other stuff you can discriminate against, are regulated. And I think this does a lot for the climate in society that our law acknowledges that public speech is also a kind of weapon that can make things go to shit in a society and needs to be regulated. \n\n\n\n\nBut lol, I forgot for a second that the states are littered with *actual* firearms. Maybe you can still follow my argument as you experience first hand what havoc those cause. Words can do the same, so it does matter if people forget what happened during the holocaust and ridicule it because we all have a responsibility as humans to not let it happen again. \n\n\n\nAnd why you would guess that someone who cares about that shit couldn't possibly be an addict is beyond me tbh.
