It always makes me feel depressed and sad and I just hate myself. Just stay away from alcohol and try something else. I would recommend amphetamines like adderall. Adderall gives me a ton of self confidence and it makes me really happy and euphoric. I think you might like it. I also have depression and anxiety and when I\u2019m on adderall I feel none of that. I usually hate myself and feel like you do now even when I haven\u2019t drank alcohol and the alcohol completely ride me of those feelings. Also you could try opiates which make you very happy and chill. Also opiates just make me feel like everything is right in the world and nothing else matters. For opiates I would recommend you try something like oxycodone or hydrocodone because those are the most common and easy to get in my opinion. Just if you try adderall or opiates make sure you don\u2019t use too often as to avoid addiction. I hope this helps\ud83d\ude42 and just know there are other people who feel the way you do, I don\u2019t know if you have clinical depression or anxiety or not but if you do just remember other people feel just like you (including me) and you are not alone.
