(opioids maybe?)", "1_Text": "It's impossible to answer this question. It could be yes. It could be no. I hope it's no. I started in on RX amphetamine when I was 14. I, too, researched about drugs tirelessly. I wanted to know why they made me feel the way they did. Couple weeks into RX amphetamine use- cardiovascular related side effects began to manifest. I stopped using it. A few months later, I discovered tramadol (an atypical opioid). During this time, tramadol's abuse potential and dependency risks were still little known, and not documented, so it was easy to acquire it via doctor. I had the best intentions. The drug simply made me feel better. What started as 50-75mg every Friday, 15 years later had  turned into 400mg daily in divided doses. I've been off the tram since October 27th, 2017. It was a joyous, and hellish 15 years at the same time. \n\nApproach her with interest in her research. It is very good she is an avid reader. It is possible researching made her curious to try opioids. With tons of research, it is doubtful she would accidentally OD or anything. But dependency and personality changing effects will occur. Just a matter of time. If she begins to act manic (overly happy), followed by lethargy and drowsiness. Keep your eyes and ears peeled. If she begins to isolate herself from friends, and has moments of severe mood swings (signs of dependency, and acute withdrawal). You yourself should research opioids. Their effects, and their withdrawal symptoms.

You may still experience some mental symptoms. But stick with kratom for 3-5 days and you will turn around. Trust me on this.
