I'm on 100mg of test which is what I started on, I'll likely be put on a higher dose (200mg) when I go back in a week or so. \n\nMy quality of life has improved tremendously in the past 30 days, I went from not being able to talk to people to having no social anxiety. I am slightly hypomanic because I am on both testosterone and vyvanse though, which his an amphetamine. \n\nSince jumping on test, I've gone from not working out at all or really going outside for 2-3 years... To working out for roughly 2 hours a day  plus an hour long walk. Maybe some sprints on top of it.\n\nI hurt so badly from all of the exercise that I've gotten it's almost absurd. The first two weeks of exercise have been humbling, I can only hope that a higher dose of test plus more protein will have me healing much faster than I do now. \n\nFWIW it took roughly 9 days for my entire psyche to change, from being horrifically depressed and unable to get any erection or even leave my home, to running sprints at random times in the middle of the day. I'm about 50 pounds heavier than I was when I know I last had normal test, so the amount of exercise I'm getting is intense.\n\nMy binge eating has completely ceased as well.

I am thinking about going up to just see how it feels, so far I haven't had any negative side effects. \n\nI am lacking sex drive just a bit still, even though I jerk off a lot. So that's a little bit of a problem too. I'm hoping 200mg/w = higher sex drive, faster recovery, better cardio, etc. \n\nYeah, my mental health was strongly influenced by my low testosterone.
