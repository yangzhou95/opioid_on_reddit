Showed up at the ER with a 107.6 degree F fever, which made the nurse chuckle and got another machine because \u201cthat couldn\u2019t possibly be correct).  Sure enough it was correct, and once they realized I was Septic, I had a team of doctors and residence (I chose to go to a teaching hospital as my primary care physician didn\u2019t have a clue what was wrong with me and I figured the more minds working together the better!).\n\nA bunch of IV morphine and 10mg oxycodone IR for pain (didn\u2019t want to give me any type of fever reducer), a diagnosis of penicillin resistant Staph A. With endocarditis of my tricuspid value acquired due to my weakened immune system due to Chikengunya and an unsanitary IV placed in my ankle in Mexico...37 days in the hospital in IV Nafcillin, discharged with a PICC line to deliver antibiotics for 2 months while at home.  Was the most miserable experience of my life, especially since I required blood cultures to be drawn drawn twice a day, while my veins were absolutely destroyed (from the blood draws, not IV needles abuse).  Wasn\u2019t allowed out of bed the entire time, lost 67lbs between April 22nd - June 7th, extreme muscular atrophy...took my months and months to gain my strength and weight back.\n\nLuckily since I\u2019m generally very healthy and was in my lower 30s, I kicked the shit out of that 30% mortality rate!\n\nUnfortunately, the staph infections attacked my knee joints, leaving me on crutches and in incredibly pain...ran into an hold \u201cfriend\u201d who helped me with the pain by getting me a few bags of dope.  Went from being perfectly clean for years to losing an amazingly high paying job and just about everything in my life as I got caught stealing from work in an attempt to support my now $3-400 habit. 2+ years later finally just getting back on my feet, though still critically underpaid as I can\u2019t pass a background check.\n\nTruly one of the few regrets I have in my life.  In the end my health is perfectly fine and slowly using my highly technical skills to freelance and get my bills paid.
