I took 500mg orally, then about an hour after I sniffed the rest of the bag. Half an hour later I decided to go for another bag, but wasn\u2019t really paying attention, and I ended up snorting .75 on top of the gram I already had. I was fine, but if I were redosing orally I wouldn\u2019t have known for 40 minutes, which can be a very uncomfortable time if you\u2019re a bit of a hypochondriac, but because I snorted it I knew within 5 minutes if I was going to be ok. So yes, the added speed can be useful. \n\nSecond is the rush. It got extremely diminished after maybe my fourth or fifth time getting on it, but if I hadn\u2019t have done it every week maybe I would have kept it. I\u2019ve never taken anything by IV, so keep that in mind when I\u2019m saying this, but the fourth time I ever got on it, I sniffed a half a Levi (250mg pills) as my initial dose, and the rush was amazing. I got pins and needles right down to my palms. If I had been expecting it it would have been great, but it blindsided me a little bit. Anyway, that\u2019s an argument for snorting for your initial dose. \n\nI\u2019ve only ever redosed orally once, and because it came on so slow I didn\u2019t really feel anything added to the experience, so I\u2019d say snorting is more euphoric as well. \n\nBy the way, MDMA is no more effective nasally than orally, so you don\u2019t need to half your dose or anything.", "2_Subreddit": "MDMA"}], "dusn6hj": [{"0_Comment Submission": "Can MDMA look like this too?
