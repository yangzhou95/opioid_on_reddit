116"I was addicted to crack and it's really hard to quit. It's all mental and really addictive. And it's not even that great of a high, it lasts mere seconds. I would spend a lot a day. One day enough was just enough for me. I walked away from it. I cut contact with the dealer that introduced it to me.         All you can do is put the pipe down and walk away. I know it's not easy but it's possible. Right now, it's your choice - do you want to keep using and lose your girlfriend and the gated house community? Crack will rape your bank account and soul until nothing is left. Crack raped my bank account in a day more than heroin ever did to me.        All you can do is walk away. The withdraws are only mental. Walk away and find a hobby that is time consuming - like video games - play Fortnite - it's a really addictive game that can be time consuming. You need something to get your mind off of it. Maybe try NA meetings, it might just work for you and/or get a sponser you can talk to when you get intense cravings.       The cravings and mental part are the worse. But a craving is just a craving and it will pass. It's been a couple years since I danced with cack for two months and I never think about it anymore. I promise it gets better in time. Cut the dealer out of your life, delete the number, flush the phone. You will lose eveything if you keep indulging in the crack - it's up to you, right now, to decide if you want to smoke crack while everything falls apart around you or man up and kick crack out of your life, count your blessings that you still have a roof over your house and invest your time, energy and money into more healthy and  productive hobbies.     Sorry for the long spill, I didn't see any other people that are using crack or have previously use crack so I wanted to give you some insight on how I quit. It's definitely possible, you just have to keep you head up and stay strong.     Last thing I'll say, you're definitely a strong person. I can see that in your post. You've picked up the pieces many times out of the dust and repaired your life. It's not worth wasting time just to lose everything again. You can do it. You can quit. All you have to do is quit. So do it. I'll be your cheerleader. PM me if you ever need to talk. Good luck OP. Much love. """""Negative
118"Hey, I've been there. Not smoking crack, but rather shooting either that or soft. Kind of the best and worst thing I told myself was that it's not a physical dependence, it's all in my head. That was good, because it meant I knew I wouldn't get sick from not doing it, and the worst because it gave me permission in my mind to keep doing it, because it's not like it was gonna be a hard kick. I did eventually get tired of the binge, cause it raped my veins and stopped being fun. I've done it since then, but never had a binge like that first one. Sorry this got long, I just wanted to let you know you aren't alone on that one. Yeah, you'll have cravings and dreams about it, but you don't have to keep doing it to feel normal.

348"This is a terrible idea.  Junkies will be junkies, but the risk for infection is absolutely not worth injecting into the groin/femoral vein.  Even the feet should be done carefully with the risk of deep vein thrombosis being that much higher, and if the person has diabetes that is asking to lose a foot. """""Negative
349"Incoming harm reduction rant:  Take care when injecting into your feet.  Clean the site VERY well since our feet are pretty dirty, and if you have diabetes or are pre diabetic do not inject into your feet AT ALL.  Diabetics normally have some form of peripheral vascular disease, and injecting here can cause a deep vein thrombosis or ‚Äúblood clot‚Äù that can travel to the brain, heart, or lungs and kill you.  Wound healing in the diabetic foot is also extremely delayed, and people lose their feet all the time.  Also, I would stay away from the groin/femoral vein because it is the dirtiest site to inject on the body, and the risk for infection is extremely high.  Doctors don‚Äôt even put femoral central lines in much anymore because even with surgical aseptic technique it is still a huge infection control issue.  You can also get blood clots injecting here, and worse an infection that goes systemic and kills you (sepsis).  Even with alcohol swabs it is not enough, and with such close proximity to the femoral artery it is not worth it.  The neck is hit or miss depending on what vein you decide to use.  Obviously from a harm reduction aspect the neck is not advised for infection reasons as well, but not as bad as the feet or groin.  Missing a shot in your neck could be very bad.  The only vein that should be attempted in the neck is the EXTERNAL jugular, because it is far enough away from the carotid arteries (you have 2 PAIRS of carotids).  Please be careful.  The INTERNAL jugular is too close to the arteries, and doctors have to use ultrasound machines to hit these veins.  DO NOT ATTEMPT.  If I were you I would stop shooting pills.  If you don‚Äôt use a micron filter your lungs are being filled with insoluble materials that will scar the alveoli, you will lose elasticity, and eventually get a form of lung disease that I can‚Äôt name off the top of my head.  These are just some of the risks of what you are attempting to do.  Use some other ROA for a while until your body bounces back a bit (if it ever does), and good luck on your journey.  If you intend to proceed anyway at least now you know some of the risks and can weigh them versus the rewards.  All of our IV journeys must come to an end someday whether it be from over use, getting clean/using other ROA, or dieing from an OD or other complication related to dirty IV practices(bacterial infection, viruses like HIV/HEP, lung disease, etc..).  Stay safe. """""Negative

And seriously, it's a lot fucking better for you than your jugular.. Peace and good luck man.. Let me know if you need any advice on how to flag the femoral.. """""Negative
352"I really don't intend to sound curt but unless you have experience injecting into your femoral vein, what do you know? One is prone to infection anywhere they inject; you are fucking injecting drugs that, most of the time, have been stomped on by numerous people with numerous different agents. As long as you take care of the femoral vein, as in: using a clean EVERY TIME, using a alcohol pad before and after on the injection site, and just not doing dumb shit like injecting things like welbutrin you can use your femoral vein literally as long as you live. Again, no offense man but i get sick of people saying that shit.

354"Are you sure you used all the veins in your hand? I thought I was completely out of veins there but I've been currently using the tiny tiny veins on the palm side of my hand. I'm not talking about the bigger ones on the actual palm, but the tiny tiny ones above it, and below the fingers (all of them below the index to the pinky). Like I've shot in a lot of different spots on one hand alone, which i never thought possible until I read someone else using their actual fingers and thought if they could hit that, i can hit these tiny ones. Just have to be very careful and slow. Sometimes it does burn alittle, but i've never had a huge lump so I'm not sure about that part. You are shooting H right?   Also, there are more veins in the hand then I thought. When I stopped using the visible ones, I would find deeper veins by using  one hand to rub the area i'm considering shooting in and it'll turn white for half a second, and i can get a visual to see if there are any light blue lines where theres a possible vein, and shoot there. Sometimes I use a pen just to dot the spot where i saw the vein because it won't be visible just by looking at your hand. But only after you rub it kind of like when you wash your hands and apply pressure you can see the veins very lightly.   I know that isn't about your feet but hope that can help you out. Good luck.

544"This isn‚Äôt related to opiates but this crazy shit just happened and I wanted to get it off my chest because one thing I don‚Äôt tolerate is drivers that are fucked up.   So my boyfriend, my really close friend Zack, and I are driving on the freeway to go cop some tar. We see this Prius up ahead and they have no lights on it‚Äôs 11pm and they almost hit the center divider. We‚Äôre like oh shit dude this person is hella fucked up. We started recording this drunk driver because this was the craziest driving we‚Äôve ever seen. Driver was zigzagging across the entire freeway. We followed her 10 minutes down the freeway and she almost hit two cars, eventually she hit a guard rail blowing out her tire. She gets off the next exit and at the stoplight Zack gets out, runs to her car pounding on her window and she skirts around the corner.  She drives over a center divider, rocks going everywhere and dirt in the air, she pulls into a Chevron and we park right behind her. Zack runs back up to her car and rips the door open and was like what the fuck are you doing?! Ironically one of our other junkie friends was at the gas station too and he and his girlfriend walk up and think we hit this girl in a fender bender? All these nosy people come up and think it was a fender bender but they leave after we tell them we got this handled.   This one chick stayed behind to help out. We find out there‚Äôs a service dog in the vehicle and that‚Äôs when I got really mad. This girl was blonde, had tattoos, total Cali girl cause that‚Äôs where we are. She try‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs from Istanbul, speaking Spanish with a British accent. Yeah, I‚Äôm not even fucking joking üòÇ this bitch wasn‚Äôt even making sense. She was saying they don‚Äôt have center dividers in her country lol and trying to convince us that she was foreign so bad. The girl who stayed back to help was calling her own AAA to get the car towed but the drunk driver was pretending she didn‚Äôt know the address. She just kept spurting out numbers in Spanish with her British accent. The drunk girl is now just saying random stupid shit trying to say her fianc√© is on his way and he owns a taxi company. I tell the girl who stayed back she can leave we got it handled.   At this point I‚Äôm so close to knocking this chick the fuck out. She‚Äôs just saying all this dumb shit and she walks up to Zack and hugs him and says Te Amo. Then she proceeds to do that to me but kisses me on my face and says Te Amo. She goes up to my boyfriend and hugs him and says Te Amo. We ask her about her service dog and we let it out of the car. Her dog was 3 and it was so skinny it looked starving! It was so fucking sad. I just walked away after this because I was about to knock her out. Only reason I didn‚Äôt was because cops kept driving by. Eventually I look out the car window when I‚Äôm in the car and I see Zack and my boyfriend talking to a cop. I get out and walk up to them. The cop asks if any of us would give a written statement. Zack apologizes to the cop and says sorry officer I just dont give info to cops I hope you understand. I volunteer and tell him I‚Äôll give one. I follow him to his cop car and he asks me what happen and I start writing the statement. Cops give her a sobriety field test and she‚Äôs failing terribly. She‚Äôs lying and still going with her story. I overhear the cops saying there‚Äôs also a cat in the car! Jesus Christ poor animals. There‚Äôs 5 cops there and finally a 6th comes with a blood testing kit cause she demanded them to test her blood. She gets cuffed and off to jail. Animals get taken to the shelter. We leave. We finally cop.   Sidenote: I had two cousins suffer from drunk driving incidents. They were brother and sister. One cousin died on her way to prom when she was 18. She was passenger and the driver was drunk. My other cousin was passenger too. He was in a coma and has never been the same since. I got hit by a drunk driver just in October. He hit me three times! Totaled my car. I‚Äôm sorry if I sound like a square for being so emotional about drunk drivers but it‚Äôs just selfish. Don‚Äôt endanger people‚Äôs lives because they didn‚Äôt ask to die or get hit by you. That‚Äôs so selfish to me. If I can interfere and stop a drunk driver from killing or hurting someone I will and I don‚Äôt care if that‚Äôs being lame.  """""Negative

Do 2.5mg doses every 60 min until you are where you want to be.  Edit: then next time you dose you could start with 5mg or higher once you know how it effects you.  Opana intranasal is VERY strong, and will give you a horrible time by the toilet puking if you do too much.  I could take 90mg of oxycodone as a snack, and 15mg of opana IN would be plenty to get me nice and high.  Be prepared to wreck your tolerance as well, and if you get hooked on the opana it was a worse withdrawal than IV heroin for me.  Opana is also the only opioid that is pretty much Heroin in pill form.  They feel very similar, and I would be in full blown withdrawal 6-8 hours after my last opana dose, and I only got up to 40mg per day IN.

My whole god damn gram is gone in a matter of hours and no closer to feeling that fucking rush but I'm definitely not sick... anyways sorry for rambling, I would like to know from someone who has IV experience (snorting/smokers need not apply, because I really don't care) if when they are covered in scar tissue if they have filled a rig with 10-20 units so that they can find a vein that is nice and sturdy for when they get to do their 3x daily shot... basically I'm asking if anyone has used a rig with water in it for \fishing\"" expedition just so that they know where and how to hit it when you have a lot less time (blood clotting up in rig).. I know that you would only need to push maybe five units just to make sure you are in and then apply firm pressure and alcohol wipes etc..so no need to do the whole harm reduction spile I just want to know the water experiment results and maybe if anyone's accidentally put water in an artery etc..thank you guys ;)"" """""Negative

1194"Hi all, first of all I'd like to say I've never used drugs much less an opiate which is why I've come here to ask this question to people who might hopefully know the answer. My boyfriend died of a heroin overdose on January 14th, I found him on the 17th because him not responding for 3 days was odd so I went over to his apartment, no spare key in the box and he had the deadbolt locked, had to have the police kick in the door. By the time we got in there, he was already decomposing because he had the heat turned up to 95 degrees, I'm wondering if using drugs (I found out later on that in the weeks leading up to this that he was also using crack and meth) would cause him to turn the heat up that much? I'm waiting on the tox report to see what exactly he had in his system but also I was wondering if heroin stacks? Like he would have used it as soon as he got it, and then when he got home probably 2 hours later and used again, if the first time he used meant it didn't have fentanyl in it, would his overdose be caused by injecting too close in time together as in when he got it, when he got home and then probably again at home? Apologies if I'm not making sense or worded it confusing, I just feel like my mind is going crazy looking for answers I may never get. His overdose was an accident, not intentional because of him telling me that morning see you Tuesday and then thru text message later that day that he found a new halfway house that he was going to move into at the end of January and he was excited to get clean again and get back on the right track.

This happened about 3 days in a row (even after I started using brand new cap, rig, cotton, etc). So a few days went by and I seemed to be okay, but now I'm getting these weird fevers again coupled with a horribly migraine that won't go away unless I'm totally in the dark.

1360"It's gonna sound like I'm being over the top. But you should see a doctor just onthe slight chance you could be septic. I recently was in the midst of WD and it was way worse then usual, I figured it was just the amount I had been using due to a break up. Nope. Now that day my mom decided to come by to say hi unannounced, and if she hadn't.. well I'd be dead right now.   She took me to the hospital just to try and get me some help, that's when I found out I was septic and dehydrated.   The next 4 days was a ton of IV fluids and powerful antibiotics. Then on day 5 when I was hoping to try and go home with a antibiotic script I was told that I also had Rhabdomyolysis as well as being septic and there was. No way I was going home. 7 days total in the hospital.if my mom didn't show up that day I would've either died from the blood infection(sepsis) or my kidneys would've failed due to not treating the rhabdomyolysis in time. And I just blamed withdrawals for how I was feeling, it's been 2 weeks since I got out of the hospital and the doctor wanted me to rest literally that whole time but I couldn't and it was and still is incredibly hard to even do everyday things without getting tired so quickly and constantly having to really try to do shit that shouldn't phase me at all is an experience of its own. But that's the after effects of  being septic , the lack of rest just amplifies it. Sorry bout this wall of text. I doubt it will even get read.. but I hope it does and someone doesn't make the same mistake I did but end up dead. It's better safe then sorry.  """""Negative
1362"It pours. And when it rains shitty dope it pours shitty dope. It hasn‚Äôt been this bad since I made the switch from oxy 3 years ago : I always have at least 1 plug w good shit, but this past week is frustrating beyond belief . All 5 of my plugs have product that ranges from undoable to below average.   And what makes it even more frustrating you ask? I‚Äôll tell u. Stamps . Not the actual glassine  bags they sell u the shit in , but the stamps they  use to ‚Äúbrand‚Äù the shit. Apparently around me they missed the day the teacher went over that. U see, . a stamp is used as an advertising tool  . For example if I get a bag with a unicorn stamped on it from Rico on Monday and my friend gets a bag with a unicorn stamped on it from Rico on Wednesday it should be the same dope.  Nope! not around here! They will put 4 different batches of dope in the same stamp rendering the whole point of stamping the product  useless .

1364"Ugh that is beyond annoying. I used to have that issue back in my hometown. One day a certain stamp would be fire with a full fat bag. The next day it was stepped on or half empty. It was always bullshit.   Where I live now, every person I know sells either half gs or gs. And they put them in the corner of sandwich baggies, and.bag it up that way. Much easier to swallow than stamped bags for sure. And it's very consistent. If someone grabs a batch that is trash, it stays trash until they reup or swap it out. If its fire, same thing it will stay that way. And it always weighs up.   I certainly don't miss the frustration you're talking about. But I totally feel you on that. """""Negative

1558"So I have a couple of questions about using subs for detox and was wondering if anyone could help me out.  First a little bit of background, been using opiates on and off for about 3 years, with my using turning heavy in the last year. I will typically go on 2-4 week binges, withdraw and binge again. Before Christmas I overdid it with Tianeptine sulfate and experience awful withdrawals (I have heard it has some of the worst) thankfully I managed to make it through them, but it almost cost me my sanity.   Of course after that I vowed never to take opiates again, just a bit of kratom so that I could enjoy New Years eve, and not be feeling to terrible as I settled into my new job. Well that obviously didn't last long and I've been abusing a long last opiate daily/once every 2 days for a month and a half (equivalent to maybe 300mg morphine or more). . I know a month is not a long time, but I haven't fully withdrawn from opiates in over 6 months. The longest I have gone without is a week but I wasn't out of withdrawals then.    I am positively terrified of the withdrawals, I am very bad at handling them. I have heard of using subs to help minimize withdrawal I know I will have to pay the price, and feeling shitty is inevitable. But I would love it even if they made them 50% more bearable.   So my questions are:  1) Does a quick sub taper help at all?  2) What dose and for how long should I take them?  3) Does it not just push the withdrawal back a couple of days?  But any information or experience from anyone who has used subs during detox would be appreciated.   TLDR: Been abusing an opiate with a long half-life. Wondering if subs could help minimize withdrawal. Wondering how much to take/how long for. Thanks! """""Negative
1562"Hey man so from my personal experience I take as much sub as I need to get comfortable the first two days maybe even on third day. So for example let's say 8mg day 1 and 2 and then maybe 6mg on day 3. On day 4 I would try to cut the dosage in half so 3mg. If it's not enough relief I would take a sliver (between 0.25mg - 0.5mg). Then day 5 try to cut the previous day dose in half again. I keep trying to cut the dose in half daily if possible. Once I can get through a day at 0.25mg I'll try to skip a day if possible. Then again cut in half so 0.125, then skip two days, dose again at 0.125, then hop off after going 3 days without dosing.   No matter what you will have to go through a period that will be uncomfortable, so the subs do prolong the inevitable; however it does make the inevitable easier.   I've had success multiple times in making the WD as mild as possible using the above method. I try to stay on subs and dose subs for the least amount of time as possible at the lowest dose possible.   Good luck man!  """""Negative

"""""Negative
1692"You got this! The first few days are obviously not fun, but then it gets better every day. It's super do-able -- tapering down as low as you did is 100% the way to go. Klonopin will be awesome for sleep -- once you can manage to get some sleep, it all gets better fast.   The weird thing about sub WDs is the up and down thing you described -- like you'll feel pretty ok, and then lousy, and then surprisingly good again. The ok periods get longer and the lousy ones will get way shorter over the next few days. The up/down symptoms have some benefits, though -- like the first time I came off sub I started feeling bad and panicked because I thought it would get worse and worse -- but then after 30 mins or so the wave of badness receded.   Anyway, other advice is regular stuff -- keep busy, don't obsess over how bad you feel. I would consider going back to work if you still are off -- having stuff to IME is WAY better than laying around at home. Like the last time I did this, on the very first day a friend had an exta ticket to a big concert -- I was reluctant because I felt lousy and it required 2 hours of public transpo to get there, but I was so glad I did it.

Last night she called me from jail and asked me to go to her mom's house and get her backpack off her bed, where she has these ridiculous high value football cards for me to sell and throw down for bail. I get the backpack and remember that her girlfriend just so happened to lose some football cards worth thousands of dollars awhile back. Strange, right?

My legs became weak and my ears started ringing. I tell her girl what's up. A little while after she called me from jail asking if I found the cards and when I can bail her out.

You would wire funds to a person in Tijuana, and then a package would arrive the next day from Southern California. They had pretty much everything from Vicodin all the way up to Fent lollypops. I never got ripped off, but lots of people did. Also similarly ordered lots of benzos and ambien and little .2mg buprenorphine tabs from India the same way. Cheap, but shipping took weeks, and if they decided to just take your money there was nothing you could do. Never happened to me, though. Only good experiences with Indian online pharmacies.   Anyway, sending money to some stranger you found on Whisper is a crazy! The whole point of Whisper or CL is to find someone local. No one in your area is selling? There is zero (or close to zero, but really I think zero) chance that this person is a fed. He or she is a zillion (10 zillion, a hundred zillion!) times more likely to be a scammer.

I took 15mg with 50mg benadryl last sunday  the on 4th. It felt good. like never smoke weed good, i could feel the nod but i can resist falling asleep and the feeling dissipates as i focus. Anyways...  I have 6 left and i don't think 3 is enough. 4 or 5 would leave with leftovers. So i want to take em' all.  so the plan is 30mg oxy, along with some potentiators:  25mg meclazine 200mg aleve beef patty with cheese grapefruit juice 15 ml dayquil  I just want to know if im safe to go for it. im not sure if the jump from 15mg to 30mg would be too much, nor am i familiar with how potent they can get.  Thanks everyone, peace and be safe! """""Negative
3583"If you want to try to save half the 6 then i would try using 3. Snort 5mg or 7.5mg or even 10mg and swallow the other rest.

Tonic water with quinine could help too, just my experience though, it's worked for me in the past but I know everyone's tolerances are different. """""Negative

Now this is the villiage. We're talking pigs in the street, no indoor plumbing kinda villiage. So I pull up and immediately see 2 older model BMW's . Trademark low level mafia guys cars. I walk around back and there is Pavel and his mom, Iveta, just absolutely beside herself. Losing her shit. Standing around them are the most stereotypical slavic guys I've ever seen. I'm talking Adidas track suit, leather hat, fake gold chain, all while each is holding a bottle of vodka and sipping on it like its a fucking bottle of bud light or something. One of those guys is Taras, a guy who is obviously his boss and some other guy in a suit.

Maybe lifting some weights before attempting to shoot might make it a little easier for them to pop out as well. And lastly, I'm pretty sure this is right but don't quote me on this: if you're dehydrated, your veins are less likely to pop out visibly, so maybe drink a good bit of liquid (just make sure tho that you're not doing enough dope to be effected by the urinary retention side effect... UGH, having a full af bladder but being just unable whatsoever to piss until enough of the dope wore off a bit killed way too many a high of mine and was the main inducer of my 'opi-rage' episodes lol. I hope these tips can help. In the sidebar, or on google, check out the 'getting off right' manual for IV drug usage, it has great visuals, tips, and harm reduction/safety tips. Best of luck in the future!   P.S. boofing is typically the only other RoA that's comparable to IV, but doesn't require finicky veins to hit... *but* it does require your bowels to be as empty as they can of all shit, which, as an opiate addict, is often not that easy lol. But it's def a good RoA if you decide you're not able to hit a vein, but still want the maximum bioavailability and the closest resemblence to a rush/very fast onset. But if you're currently constipated and unable to shit out enough before dosing, then I'd say intranasal is the best bet then for you (even the water/dope/blood mix from your rig can be injected into your nose without the needle of course, only the syringe).   Hopefully you're able to go for the RoA you like best when you're able to do dope, but if you've tried a bunch and still can't get a vein, at least you can always boof or snort the solution. Hell even just adding a bunch of water and drinking it would be better than wasting it... but ik how bad the blood can harden/congeal in the rig if not dealt with quick enough once the blood enters the barrel of the syringe, and it depends how much blood/dope/water is in the mixture """""Negative

1"Posted this on my old accout in 2016, it still applies though. Except with the refugee influx, we have a bunch of North africans/Syrians peddling bunk dope. Absolutely wouldn't recommend picking up from them folk, get your dope from Russians or Iranians like any kraut junkie worth his salt.  Germany has a pretty interesting dope scene, you wouldn't expect us to, but it's vibrant. Open air markets are pretty rare, save for major cities (by German standards, so at least 500k people). To make up for that we have other Junkie meet-up spots, like using kit vending machines, Methadone/Heroin clinics, or fixing rooms. Just shoot the shit with the locals, offer to toss them a bag or two, walk to the spot with them, and of course, DON'T LET YOUR MONEY WALK (some things are universal it seems). Get a number and there's your connect. The dope is always brown pretty much, it comes in from the ports of Amsterdam and Northwest Germany, at least that's my theory since the quality of dope is proportional to your distance from the Netherlands. Your gear comes wrapped in multiple sheets of plastic, my connect usually kept it in a fanny pak, which I thought was hilarious seeing him seemingly reaching into his crotch to pull out my product. You call the guy, he tells you where he's at, you take a walk (public transit fam, it's decent over here), and hand that shit over when you made sure feds ain't watching. So where do I fit into this? I'll keep it short since I don't wanna dwell on past fuck-ups too much. I'm currently in my mid-20s, med-school dropout, slow-as-mud recovering fiend and wageslave. 5K in the hole to boot, turns out you can't spend your academic scholarship on dope and coke when you end up dropping out two semesters in. Who'd a thought?! I don't fit into this scene at all, but it got me out of many sketchy situations where people who looked a bit more down on their luck to put it mildly got stopped and searched. Sat next to a cop on the train home with a gram and a half under my tongue, thank fuck it was wrapped up good. One of my more recent memories is meeting up at a train station which I will not disclose since it was pretty close to where I live. Wait for the d-boy to show up, he takes us on a wild goose chase around the city. First he has to pick up a recipe at the pharmacy (benzos, what else), then he starts getting into a public shouting match with a customer we ran into who had wronged him in the past (way to keep this discreet!). Randomly he stops to smoke his shitty spice, telling me to position myself in a way to hide him doing the deed. After a while he tells us to wait in a local park, he's gotta go to the source, break up the dope and bag it up. I am hurting at this point, it's been 24 hours. I hand him my 80 bucks though, since he's been trustworthy in the past and commence to lay down on a park bench. So here we are, four fiends growing more and more nervous every minute, pacing up and down, peeking down the street he left for. One hour, two hours. I'm starting to put this down as a loss when he walks up like an angel bringing the gospel of soon-to-be shot dope. Next thing we  head down to the local fixing room and prompty get denied. It's full apparently, fuck that's what I get for copping during junkie rush hour. We ask if we can be admitted into the other rooms out back, but they're apparently reserved for people smoking crack and dope, we're not allowed to shoot up back there since they can't guarantee we'll be attended to in the way appropriate for someone injecting (no staff, no clean needles to hand out, yadda yadda). We say fuck this, walk a few roads down to the next park and shoot up using our nasty ass rigs with the numbers off, as well as our dull as fuck needles. It did the job done more than well, I nod out immediately, my using ‚Äûbuddies‚Äú take off with my cotton and rig (lol), the cops mistake me for a drunk (it was Oktoberfest season), all is well. So that was that. If anyone is interested, I'll see if I can think of another story.  """""Negative

339"It's a long story, but basically I ended up putting myself into detox for Kratom (yes, Kratom) - you can see the full story in my post history. I got prescribed Suboxone 8mg per day and am supposed to see a Sub doc on Wednesday.  I also was taking 6 grams per day of Phenibut on average along with ~30 - 40 grams of Kratom before detox. During the 6 days I was in detox, they pumped me with a shitload of Phenobarbital for the Phenibut piece of the puzzle - 194.4 mgs for a few days, then a quick taper down to 64.8mg the day of discharge last Thursday. They then set me free with 5 32.4 mg pills as needed basically. I took two (64.8 mg on Friday), and on accident (seriously) took three yesterday 97.2mg. I meant to save the last for tonight but forgot I'd already taken two, to make the comedown smoother but whatever. I also was feeling incredibly anxious last night so I broke down and took 3 grams of Phenibut. Obviously I slept but this seems incredibly dangerous.   Point is, has anyone else here taken Phenibut with their opiate of choice? I really don't see myself just not taking any more Phenibut suddenly just because I got a weeks worth of Phenobarbital tapered extremely quickly. I'm sure I can skip the day dose of Phenibut. I can prob go down to 1.5 or 2 grams of Phenibut at night and taper down. At detox they didn't seem concerned giving me a hardcore, long acting barbituate in high doses with 8mg Suboxone - they only monitored my vitals in the morning, and let me sleep on huge doses of it alone in my room. I was a fucking total zombie the first two/three days: no memory of what was going on. I'm with it now and trying to figure out a plan here. Any thoughts? I don't know what to do exactly. I feel like they just staved off the Phenibut w/d with a barbituate and now I'm on an opiate that causes respiratory depression which Kratom didn't. Problem with Kratom was it was giving my tinnitus, and it was feeling unsustainable taking dose after dose since it had a short window of action.  I didn't feel any trouble breathing at all last night, but so what? I talk to a doctor on Wednesday. I'd really appreciate any advice rather than insults for how stupid I've been or whatever. I think it's clear I have an addiction problem and this is not remotely my first rodeo with substances: it's just the current set.

I'm a dope user, but I'm currently in the process of quitting (perpetually so). I was using basically every day, maybe a half gram to a gram or so, but it was pretty bunk shit, so take that with a grain of salt, it wasn't a HUGE habit or anything. So I went four days without using and my withdrawal symptoms were basically subsiding, RLS was subsiding big, I could actually get comfortable, still getting the chills and having diarrhea, but for the most part a mild day four. Well I used like 0.2 that night and went like two more days without using, but I was definitely experiencing WD symptoms slightly worse than I was on day four prior, but still not bad, just sweating like a mfer at night. So yesterday I needed to work a job outside for 8 hours straight. I'm starting to umpire youth baseball. So even though the WD symptoms weren't horrible by any means, the last thing I wanted was to be having the chills and hot/cold sweats while being outside in the cold and wind for 8 hours straight. So, I dosed about 0.25mg of sub, and it was enough to make me feel good, like I was completely clean. No euphoria or anything, just clean. Well it has now been 38 hours since I dosed that and I'm starting to get the chills again, so obviously I'm starting to WD from the sub. I start a new job on Thursday the 15th and *really* do not want to be having any WD symptoms when I start. In y'all's experience, do you think I should be fine by then? Do you think the WD I'll experience up until then will even be that severe? I know sub WD is supposed to peak around 72 hours, so I'm hoping it won't be too bad since I'm half way there and only have minimal symptoms, but I also know that sub WD can last a really long time, and I'm worried about not being over it by Thursday, or worst case scenario, having the WD be so drawn out that I don't start feeling really shitty until the middle of the week.

869"Hi guys and gals, just did a shot of tar and as soon as I registered into a tiny vein on my hand, I started pushing slowly on the plunger. The first initial push stung like a mofo but didn't really burn after that sting when I tried pushing it in very very slow to see if the sting would happen again. It is kind of strange because I kept puling the plunger back to make sure i was still registered throughout. I went really slow and injected the H probably over 60 seconds.  1) I have hit an artery before (Or nerve) and it also stung and burned in those situations so I've had to pull the whole rig out. There was one time I was very naive (sometimes still am) and kept pushing the plunger in while it burned but whole area was so numb from it I didn't feel much pain when doing that. (1A) - but Do you guys think shooting into an artery would sting throughout the whole shot? (1B) And do you think it's possible that the needle tip was just partially in my vein and out at the same time where it could register blood, but also 'miss' partially if injected? Not sure if it matters but the vein I used is really small. It kind of runs over the pink knuckle and is barely visible.  2) After the shot, the area around it, about a 1 inch circumference, became alittle raised and random raised bumps showed up on my wrist and forarm also. Do you think that's an allergic reaction, or from a partial miss or definitely artery hit? Besides those raised areas, nothing else is puffy like when I hit an artery before. Also, nothing really hurts. 3) Random question I always wondered, When you guys put the cotton in the dope to draw up, how big of a piece do you use and do you actually stick the needle tip into the piece of cotton or just kind of push the tip against it and apply pressure while drawing it up?  Thanks all! Enjoy the rest of the night.  """""Negative
870"Don't even try to shoot into tiny veins like that because you'll pretty much always miss atleast some of it, or completely blow the vein out. Sounds like you probably pushed through it and missed most of your shot. If you hit an artery your whole hand would swell up and it would feel way way way worse than what you described. I use a cotton about the size of a BB. I make sure the bevel is facing downward and I push down on the cotton when I draw the shot up, I don't push the needle through the cotton. Kinda hard to explain because I'm thwacked out as fuck but I hope you know what I mean. Edit: also the bumps you're talking about is a histamine reaction from missing part of your shot.

I lost more than 5 jobs while going to the clinic because they didn't give a fuck I worked 1st shift.

With companies on an attendance point system, it doesn't take long to point out while trying to maintain a normal life doing the right thing.

2004"I want to talk about this/write it down so that I don't forget and veer off onto the wrong path again. Yesterday, I felt the most uncomfortable and painful feelings in my life. I used to do a lot of pills and cocaine when I was a teenager but grew out of that. Once I lost my brother I developed an alcohol addiction. Then, back in December, I shot heroin for the first time.  But before all I did was drink. I live with someone who has been a heroin addict for 5 years. I told him to go to a clinic and he agreed he would go. We had to pay $15 a day for a Methadone dose for him every morning. We used to work together and both lost our jobs because I was his manager and we were sleeping together. It's a bit more complicated than that though. He is from Romania and would screw up the register almost every night because he had trouble with our currency. My boss thought he was stealing from the drawer and would always ask me to keep an eye on him. Since I was always closing with him, and sleeping with him, they fired both of us.  The fun started when I got really drunk and we decided to buy some ice. I asked him to give me some because I was drunk and wanted to try it and he complied. I was addicted to the rush and had fun with it at first but it got old because we couldn't sleep and we started getting paranoid. Then we would miss the clinic and he told me he needed dope. Now I know he was bullshitting me but I didn't know, I felt bad for him.  Eventually, I started to do it. Then we ran out of money, cuz no job and paying $15 a day. We were getting dope by getting points for our dboy and giving him rides wherever he needed to go, selling off our shit, lying to our friends and family what we needed the money for until we exhausted all of our options. Eventually, we were both using every day until a few days ago. We had nothing, negative money in the account, burned bridges, no dope, no methadone, no food or gas money, no weed, smokes or beer to take the edge off.  Then withdrawal hit and holy hell. I had been through alcohol withdrawal and I know it can kill you but goddamn the withdrawal from dope was one of the most painful things I've experienced. I hit rock bottom. This guy doesn't love me, I know that but I'm glad he was there for me. He just held me in his arms while I shook and tremored and felt like I was dying. My bones hurt so bad I couldn't hold still. We just lied there in silence, other than my groans of pain, and I looked up in my dim room wondering what the fuck happened. How if I just died right then everything would be okay, well, for me. I had no prospects for the future and owe an ungodly amount of money and apologies to my friends and family. I hated my life and how I was so fucking stupid to put myself through this shit and how I let the man next to me down. I was supposed to help him and instead, I enabled him and used him, let him use me.  It's day 4 of being almost completely sober, took tylenol and vaped some tobacco, and I feel positive. Time to dig myself out of this mess. Not sure why I feel this unprecedented euphoria and positivity but I'm gonna take it and run with it. I don't really have any words of wisdom or encouragement for you guys but just knowing I won't be judged for talking about this gives me comfort. I barely had a taste of that life and now know I don't want to live that way, I can see it getting so much worse. I've seen how our dboy lives and read stories on here of withdrawing in prison. Maybe I'm a little bitch for typing this out but whatever, we all have our own paths. I was miserable unless I was watching him cook up the dope for us. Now I look forward to seeing the beauty life has to offer again and maybe this time, without the alcohol.  Thanks for reading. """""Negative

There is a 99% chance, in MY experience and countless others‚Äô, that you will not be able to get high just one time.  And every time i start using again my life gets progressively worse.   Like i said just always remember this pain you are going through, and when your brain tries to get you to do some dope, remind it that you dont want to go back to your lowest point.  I get what you are saying that you are in the rut of your life.  But the term rock bottom is generally used by addicts when we are at EXTREME lows.   I am not a big believer of the term rock bottom anyway because I always think I am at my trough, and then i end up doing worse shit that before, creating a new ‚Äúrock bottom‚Äù.   Its just surprising to me to see such a mild story associated with the term. Usually i hear, ‚Äú i sold my whip. Or i pawned my grandmas ring, or i robbed my best friend, caught a case, hepatitis c, overdose‚Äù Not just the basic ‚Äú i spent all my money and pawned my shit and my family doesnt trust me‚Äù these may sound terrible by your, or a normal persons standards, but by junkie standards it is basically normal.  And if you keep using, your standards will generally keep dropping.  Even at 4 months of continuous clean time, and only a 3 week slip up in the past year, i still find myself thinking in different ways. Much different than normal people.  Like for instance a lady at work used the expression ‚Äúare you smoking crack?‚Äù When someone said something ridiculous.

I'm not really sure what other word I would use in lieu of it, though. Maybe in a sense rock bottom is realizing there may never be a true rock bottom for some people. I realized when I typed this out I may sound like a little bitch or something for saying this is my rock bottom. I had a pretty good childhood and was very blessed with a wonderful family. Which is what makes me feel worse in a sense because I really had no reason to do this except curiosity and recreation. I honestly wouldn't have even considered it if I hadn't been drinking for the past 10 years with no change in my situation. I was miserable before and just looking to feel something I guess.  Regardless of who you are and where you come from I think feeling like you're going to die because of your own choices can make anyone feel at the bottom.

Veins there are pretty close to surface so go in at a 30-40 degree angel and just as soon as 1/16-1/8th of the tip is in draw the needle about 5-10units back and hold. Little trick here is to put a keyring  only slightly bigger than your index finger around the back of the plunger, makes awkward one handed shots easier. Very slowly push the needle in and stop when blood enters. Hold still and push very slowly down. Shouldn‚Äôt feel a thing if anything a cold feeling. If it burns for even a second stop, pull out and try again same spot. Will hurt going in a little bit get past it. Anytime you miss a vein you‚Äôll need to get the air back out.

When you're in the vein for sure you should untie your tourniquet, however it's really easy to pop out of your vein in the process. Personally I never bother removing it before I inject myself.

Haven‚Äôt been sick or anything, so that‚Äôs a good thing. Kept getting the run around on a lot of things, but what‚Äôs new. Anyways, this couple that my girl knows needed a ride to go pick up. Unless it‚Äôs worth my time I don‚Äôt fuck around with shit like that since it seems like I‚Äôm the only one around the area that still has a car and hasn‚Äôt sold it for drugs or some shit like that. Back to the couple. They said it would be worth my time and made sure it was going to be. Was still skeptical cause I‚Äôve heard that before and it wasn‚Äôt, figured if it was something like that again, I‚Äôd just kick em out of my car. For one, it was midnight, going through smaller towns and then hitting back roads. Sketches me out cause cops are dicks and think if you‚Äôre out that late, your up to no good. Long story short, split 3 30s between 4 of us. Haven‚Äôt had anything but .5mg of a sub 28hrs before that. Got first pull and split it with my girl. Did the shot and waited....and waited and waited. Didn‚Äôt feel a damn thing. Other couple didn‚Äôt feel a damn thing either. Figured at least ONE of us would have felt a little something. Got to lookin at the other 3 pills and they were m box 30s. Wellllll, that shit was fake as fuck! Still wondering what the fuck I shot up. Obviously wasn‚Äôt something horrible cause we‚Äôre all still fine. Very first time I‚Äôve ever come across a pressed pill, around my area. Its not common whatsoever here cause a lot of people haven‚Äôt even heard of presses and shit like that. Like I‚Äôve said in previous posts, live around a bunch of redneck tweakers. Basically a shit post but just still in shock. The guy tasted one after we all realized it wasn‚Äôt what it was supposed to be and he said it wasn‚Äôt bitter at all. I guess it wasn‚Äôt too bad cause I got another 8mg sub strip for $10 from a buddy I went to way earlier in the day for rox 20s but ended up being phenfrazine or some shit like that. Wasn‚Äôt his fault since he doesn‚Äôt dabble in this game much but he felt bad for me coming and not getting what I was hoping to get and felt compelled to find me something.

2631"but thats exactly what they are trying to do, https://www.heroinhelper.com/curious/chemistry/purifying_heroin.shtml its pretty basic, they make a hydrochloric acid solution to dissolve the black in a test tube and let that settle and pipette all the liquid out leaving behind the bulk of the insoluble particulate matter. they then add ammonium hydroxide to the solution to precipitate the soluble impurities out of the liquid as well. this is where im kinda lost  cause i do see reputable sources saying ammonium hydroxide is used to precipitate morphine from opium/acid solution, but i wonder does it also precipitate heroin? obviously we are dealing with something that already was seperated from the morphine. its been a while since chem and i was not a genius in that area for sure lol. anyway after that it follows the basic heroin recipe skipping the acetylization process and they add ethyl ether to make the water settle to the bottom and remove it from the heroin solution? then deacidify with baking soda until it stops bubbling and allow that to air dry giving you what they say is pure heroin and NaCL  thats a good question on why wouldnt cartels do it if it were so simple? perhaps it has a really poor yield? like if their total yield after converting was low enough that the premium price they would charge wont cover it then they wont. maybe they just dont like change lol. i do think you would be hard pressed getting these less educated junkies which are most of them, to pay a premium for what looks like a lot less to them though its actually super strong and its foreign looking to them. i thought about that when i considered if i could be the only powder dealer around here, even if it wasnt real 4 heroin it would be real strong but i doubt anyone would want to pay more. there are some things that dont make sense to me about the recipe but like i said i know about as much as the average person does about chemistry """""Negative
2633" also im wondering, since my main goal is to make bth easier on the veins and make it stronger i wonder if i really need to go through the step where i remove the soluble material, if i just extract the bth acid solution ill have removed the bulk of the unwanted contaminants, and if i dont have to spend money on ammonium hydroxide that would be nice not to mention that precipitate may remove other opiates present in bth that id rather keep. the soluble cut probably wouldnt amount to much i could then just skip straight to the deacidification get some litmus paper and add the baking soda like directed. ive actually heard of people straight adding baking soda directly to a shot of black but im not sure if this is advised """""Negative

Found this out after randomly noticing my Costco stopped carrying them. The price of them on Amazon is skyrocketing so I think retailers are already beginning the process of getting rid of their loperamide in favor of the 8 packs. The reason they did this is because there were 24 cases of heart issues in 8 years associated with loperamide. That sounds like a really low number to warrant this action, but as we know the government does all they can to ensure you rely on prescription drugs and heroin. Good luck to you guys!

4168"So for the first time today, I had to Narcan somebody. I was at my dealers house and this other kid was there. He had gotten clean and this was his first time using... And of course he ODs... No breathing, skin turning grey, etc. My dealer has 2 4mg Nasal Narcans and one .1mg IM Vial. Within 30 seconds and realizing that the kid has gone down, I have the first nasal dose given. Nothing happens after 30 seconds to a minute. I give it a second dose and again nothing happens. By this point, we are all starting to freak out. Wondering if we're going to have to call 911, etc. My dealer is slapping him, icing him, etc. and about a minite or two later we say f*** it and I IM the dose into his thigh. Within 2 minutes, he is coming too and 30 minutes later he is fine. Now I know that it could be a dose thing, but I know this kid did a pretty small bow shot and we've tested, and there's no fentanyl in the dope. Typically, in these situations, when I've been around, I've only seen people get one dose and then they're fine. This time though it took 3. As such, in the future, I'm wondering if I need to be leery about the nasal stuff. Like I said, it seem to do nothing until I gave the injection. I know it could be cumulative dosing but like I said before I've never seen it take more than one with such a small heroin dose. Has anyone else experienced this?

There is tons of vendors in r/Kratom and there is a variety of strains to give you different effects. My favorite strain is Bali Gold, but I would suggest ordering a sampler pack and trying a few and finding the right dose is tricky.  If that doesn't scratch your itch, also look into CBD.

The therapy involves the controlled application of sub-atmospheric pressure to the local wound environment, using a sealed wound dressing connected to a vacuum pump. The use of this technique in wound management increased dramatically over the 1990s and 2000s and a large number of studies have been published examining NPWT. NPWT appears to be useful for diabetic ulcers and management of the open abdomen (laparotomy) but further research is required for other wound types.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/opiates/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 """""Negative

1232"yeah sorry I thought i had a solution, but i tried experimenting on myself (i have like 500 used rigs i been meaning to dispose of properly) and it was working up until you pull back to register in the vein. If you pull back too hard or fast, the piece comes apart. But basically, if you see your plunger has the black rubber piece which goes into the syringe first. You can pull that off easily and insert it onto something else that will fit in the syringe. I tried placing the black rubber piece on the long thin piece inside a pen which has the ink tip on it. (Forgot what its called), and on the opposite side of the side with ink. It fit pretty well and inserts pretty easily. If the dope was freshly mixed with water and moved smoothly, I think it would work. but since the dope is mixed with blood and harder to press, when you insert it and pull back, the pen piece comes out, which will leave the black plunger piece stuck in there. If you can find a better item to stick the black piece on, so it won't come off easily, it might work. (Perhaps a thin screwdriver? Because the item inserted into the black rubber piece needs to have a wider circumference at the end then the middle, so it doesn't slip out when you move it back and forth inside the plunger- idk if that makes sense?) Or let us know how the dental floss/toothpick works. """""Negative

And once my tolerance tanked it would not have been doable. Realistically I could have maintained this way for maybe a year or two.When I did pills, it was a matter of picking up a prescription or waiting for the mailman to get there. When I lost access to pills, I switched to heroin and my life began to revolve around all the logistics that come with chasing dope: finding reliable plugs, figuring out who has the best product, figuring out when and where the plug can meet me, dodging the police- constantly having my head on swivel and dealing with close calls. Then there‚Äôs the whole issue of always having to be near your sources - it gets hard to leave town. By the time I got to the end of this road it was hard for me to even go out for a night.Dope did feel similar to oxy, but there was something about it for me that made it harder to parcel out to myself on a reasonable schedule.

Sometimes it‚Äôll be bomb, sometimes decent, sometimes garbage. At least that‚Äôs how it is where I live and I rode that train for 10 years. Your amounts you need are going to switch up. It‚Äôs harder to stay well steadily - you tend to get more of the extremes.The other thing - really not trying to be an ass, I swear - but a lot of people just can‚Äôt do dope for a long time without going to needles. I was the last person I ever thought would shoot up, but it‚Äôs too big a payoff. I hated needles, could not watch when I got a flu shot.

So my doc told me he could up my oxy to 4 a day to cover the 5 days waiting on the Oxymorphone. I told my doc if he wanted to, he could do two 10mg pandas because the pharmacy already has those from ordering them last month and that if he did that I would not have to wait on the meds and he wouldn't need to up my oxy to cover. He was pumped when I thought of that and he believes I don't want pills just to have more pills to sell or get high. I mean, yeah, I really wanted the extra 30 oxy mints, but things like that pay off down the road. For instance, next month I am going to ask for the panda 20mg because thirty 20mg pills will cost a little less than sixty 10mg pills (with waayy less fillers clinging up my nose) and he knows I am saving up for my next spinal  procedure. So when he does that I will work in the extra oxys to cover the days without the pandas.

She comes up with these horrid exaggerations, and the gruesome or tragic content does get her the attention she craves, but as these awful tales cement into reality in her mind, it makes her suffer. Horribly. And *because it's a lie, it's impossible to give her comfort*. Because she has a strong built-in instinct to protect the lie, so any attempts to show the truth are met with either deflection or blame, even when it's completely illogical.Dude... she's a doctor. Practiced medicine for decades. She's not senile. She's still the director of a medical facility and she's still incredibly intelligent.

Honestly, I don‚Äôt get why meth is such a problem when opiates are soooo much better! I do meth because it‚Äôs what I can get, but I‚Äôm in love with the feeling of oxy already. I‚Äôd choose an oxy high over meth any day. My usual dose of oxycodone (1-2 times weekly) is 30mg, crushed pills. The problem I‚Äôm faced with? There‚Äôs no supply! Everyone here is doing meth so I only manage to get oxys when somebody I‚Äôm hanging out with has them in their medicine stash. Sure, there‚Äôs always the onion patch.. but even then, domestic opiate pharms (Australia) are expensive as fuck! So that leaves me with two choices...

I‚Äôm already a meth addict... so there‚Äôs no ‚Äòheroin is bad ahh I‚Äôm scared‚Äô mental barrier sorta thing. The thought of fent scares me though.. How does heroin compare to oxy? I assumed it would be stronger mg to mg.. but from what I‚Äôve read, oxy is typically stronger. If I managed to get some good quality H from the onion fields, what dosage can I expect to get me where 30mg oxy gets me? Is it a similar high or totally different? Elaborate? I‚Äôd prefer to avoid the needle.. what other ROA will get me feelin‚Äô nice? Can I simply weigh x amount of h, cap it and swallow it?

Realistically there isn‚Äôt much of a difference, oxy might be a bit more energetic and of course you never know exactly what‚Äôs in that bag of dope. But the rest is up to you.

And didnt want to get hooked again. Took 20mg like once every one or two months and everything was good... it was equal to heroin use ime. It is not this overwhelmingly powerful as someone describes the first shot and it easily gives you a couple hours of joy without to much compulsiveness. The downward spiral started when I first tried fent-patches(extracted and snorted, later smoked) cause of the urge to redose a hour later. I couldnt have a great night without redosing and the process stuck in my head. Even now (after half a year of clean time) I think about smoking fent and how fucking good it was just cause I read your post.

3196"A few days ago I ran into an old friend at the gas station. He was filling out a lotto ticket at the counter with his back to me. I walked up behind him and said, ‚Äúhey, you got those lotto folds?‚ÄùHe smiled and we talked for a while. I could tell he was pissed about something but in line at the gas station wasn‚Äôt the place to hash it out. I spent the rest of the day trying to recall just what I did to fuck him over and the only thing I could come up with is that I showed his son how to use a needle. Truth be told, at the time I was under the impression that his son, my good friend at the time, had shot up before because he told me as much. He said he was having a hard time hitting and asked if I‚Äôd help. So I did. Soon after I moved to the otherside of the country and ten years slide by. I move back and find out my homie got popped writing bad scripts, reduced his time by ratting on his friends, and still did time on a handful of felonies. I‚Äôm almost certain that he told his folks I taught him to use a needle and in their minds all of the shit their kid did is my fault.This wasn‚Äôt the first time shit like this happened either. Years ago a girl I ran with and dated did the same thing. Told me she shot up before and asked if I‚Äôd help her hit. Again, she came from a dope using family so I didn‚Äôt question her. Fast forward a few years and she‚Äôs downstate turning tricks and a few people want to fuck me up for introducing her to the needle....The thing is, in both cases, I probably would have shown them both how to inject if they had been honest about it being their first time. I used to volunteer at a mobile syringe exchange, I‚Äôm a proponent of harm reduction and have seen and lived the consequences of unsterile injection practices. On the other hand I do feel a little guilt about the way things turned out for these two. Is it my fault? Fuck no. Ive been using a needle on and off since 98 and have managed to do it without sucking dick or hanging my ass out for garunteed felony time.None the less r/opiates, I‚Äôm curious about your opinions and experiences. Has a desire to practice harm reduction ever painted you as the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù? Have you ever felt responsible on any level for leading a pal down a dark path?  """""Negative
3197"I think I never had anything to do with people that young, except for the time I myself was as young. And at that time I used to hang with much older people. I still had the term bad influence attached to my name, tho (jokingly I hope). Last year I fixed a friend who only snorted dope for more than 10 years his first shot. But he asked me to and after he didn't fell down the rabbit hole anymore than he already had, so we still cool. And another friend, too, when I'm thinking about it. He didn't stick with the needle either, I'm glad to say. I know it wouldn't be my fault, but still, I'd feel a little guilty I think. But in the end, we're all old enough to make out own decisions. And when some little shit decides to steal and lie and trick people into helping them with becoming an addict, they will. Parents who blame others for the shortcomings of their lil angels fail their kids as parents. If they don't recognize that their kid has a fucking problem and pretend that humans work like that, they are the bad guys. No one I know or heard of got forced or seduced to use.

We were texting, i had no idea how old she was but she claimed she was older than she was, and dating some dude in his late 20s who had just got locked up. He was her connect. She was hooking me up with a ton of bars for some dope, cuz her bf was the only one she knew with a plug. So the first time we meet I'm on my way to her and she mentions she couldn't grab rigs and asked me to. No problem. Well i show up and she is clearly young af and needed me to get rigs cuz she's to young. She also has a broken arm and couldn't hit herself because of it and asked me to do it for her. I don't use needles but i know how, and since i was already there and whatnot i decided to help her. I loaded up the smallest amount possible, and she ended up not feeling a thing cuz i honestly didn't want to do it but figured at that point I'd go through the motions to get my bars. I never helped her after that. I spoke to her a few times since and she was in a bunch of trouble for stealing a bunch of laptops from her high school. I don't blame myself for any of her actions, i was tricked into the situation. I should have said fuck it and left but i was in a bad way and really needed those bars to help detox myself. I did what i could to make the best of a bad situation. I don't think you are to blame for those peoples mistakes.

Thats literally the main thing there looking for I had plenty of self harm scars at the time and they never said shit about them. But yeah the first time they have to do an intake and get all your info call the centers and see what paperwork you need to bring, I had to bring i.d. and a W-2 / social security card. But every time we went after that we would just go to a terminal and you'd answer a bunch of questions ( same shit every time just asking specific ass questions but one of them is do you currently use drugs and do you consent to a blood test if they feel like you are , and if you have to agree if you want to donate lol) but honestly I saw way worse people then me and my girl in there and if we were there you bet your ass we were W/D hard Fucking core. But anyways you do the questions then go to evaluation where they check your blood Everytime and your pulse/ heart rate and check for track marks, as long as you only have a mark from the plasma need your golden. But if you pass evaluation you go into another line where you wait for a chair to open up. it just depends how busy and what day it is, some days I'd be there for 4 hours and some days I'd be in and out asap it just depends.It definitely makes you a little woozy after but if your already W/D I promise it won't stop you we would immediately go pull the cash out as soon as we were done.( If you have good blood flow the general time is 45 mins - an hour to finish donating AFTER your hooked up and already donating and all that.) And also they don't do cash at least not here, they give you a credit card with a pin and you can pull cash out at special ATM's or gas stations that allow cash back.I couldn't tell you how much you'll get paid, for me the first 5 visits we're 50$ per person and then after that it's 24$-34$ (depends on weight the heavier you are the more plasma you can give and gett paid more) but like I said this is how it was for me. I'm in the southwest region. The place I went to was CSL Plasma so idk how many other centers they have but I'm sure the rules are the same, good luck man it's not t to bad after the first time.

Be polite and respectful, but It's a million times better to stay silent than to lie to the officers. If you think you might get arrested, then they've already made up their mind to arrest you.

3951"I'll share my most recent one, it's not that bad but it's funny.Okay so there's a couple cops that like to sit in front of my house everyday. (I'm 72 days clean and kicked everyone that was staying here out, and they finally just stopped sitting out front everyday) They've been doing this for at least a year and haven't gotten shit out of it except more salty, lol. Like anyone they see leaving my house is guaranteed to get pulled over. They just make up reasons to pull them over and search their cars and interrogate them about what's up at my house.So anyway this happened when I was like 40ish days clean or so. Haven't had anyone at my house at all, so the cops are bored.I was going to go help someone out, but when I pulled out I notice headlights turn on and pull out behind me. Fucking pig. So I head to a gas station near my house and pull in. Of course they follow me there and pull in right next to me just staring at me. I call the person I'm supposed to be meeting and tell them they're shit out of luck and to call someone else. Now I'm about to go grab a pack of cigs but I realize I didn't bring any cash with me. So I take another call and chat for a sec, then I'm like fuck it, and drive home. The cop follows me home, staying right on my ass. I pull into my driveway and they park on the street right before my driveway.I go in the house ditch my shit and grab some cash and head back to my car. Cops still waiting. Lol. So I pull out in front of them and head back towards the store. They make a U Turn and are right behind me pretty quickly.Now I pull back into the store and go grab my cigs. The cop pulls into the lot next to the store facing my car. I take my time in the store. I walk out and pack my cigs while making direct eye contact with piggy. I slowly get back into my car and fuck around with the radio for a minute and light a cig and get comfy. I pull back out and head home. The cop immediately follows me again! Lmao. I couldn't help but laugh about it at this point. I pull back into my driveway and they park right before it again. I go inside satisfied with how much time they just wasted. They sat there for a while before pulling off probably feeling salty as fuck. They haven't followed me again since. """""Negative

3999"I must vent for a minute! Back in september I got into an accident. It was a beautifull day and I was hiking the cliffs by me, it started to rain so I headed back, got in my car, put on some tunes, pulled out of the lot and then that's when the day turned, it was also the last day I walked on my own two feet.[Now the accident, I dont remeber, but it was my fault. It was a shitty road and rainy but I was going too fast and wasn't paying attention, I'll totaly own up to that, lesson was learned. I'm still recovering from that terrible car accident.]After being helped out of the car [adrenaline is crazy] and lying on the side of the road covered in glass, blood and with multiple broken bones. [thought I was gonna loose my leg] I was strait sober, BUT I had my nectar collector, oil, some pills and a few tabs of lsd in my backpack, I woulda chucked it all in the woods if I coulda moved. Anyway the park ranger showes up and dose absolutely nothing for me, he just immediately starts searching the car, opens my backpack like a kid at Christmas, asking me a bunch of dumbass questions and doesn't ask me if I'm even ok. [I was litteraly dying] He goes though my whole car [what was left of it] found a bunch of empty whip it canisters in my trunk, in my recycling with some empty beer cans, again recycling. [I live in the middle of nowhere so I gotta drop that shit off] Eventually emt's show up, had to get airlifted to hospital, blacked out before it even showed, woke up days later in the hospital on a ventilator, multiple blood transfusions, my moms crying, just sucked yo. Come to findout from a nurse, the same cop was calling the hospital to get blood samples trying to make his case against me I guess. Only had thc in my system at the time [thc is in my bone marrow, lol] Anyway they told him to fuck off, they were awesome at the trauma unit, hooked me up with the iv dillauded, you know, with the button, just press as needed, aaaaaaaah....The ranger had my phones, money [had a few Hundo on me] and backpack with all my shit in it as evidence, wouldn't give me my phones back because I wouldn't give them the passwords. [fuck that!] Took forever to get back, had to get a lawyer, got a STACK of tickets and shit, DUI, possesion of various substances, paraphernalia, wreckless driving, so on and so on. I gotta go to federal fucking court cause it was on federal land [national park]. Dude threw the book at me and just made a bunch of shit up. For example, texting and driving which I wasn't and no seat belt which I had on, I litterally have the scar to prove my seatbelt was on and surley woulda died if I didnt, just a heartless Bastard.I lost my car, still can't walk, have damages to pay, can't work, strait broke, bored, sober, had to move out of my place, almost out of food, the worst. Once again I was strait sober, I was on my way to a friends house to get fucked up, but I'm still getting an OUI, I'll most likely loose my licence and federal laws on possesion are not kind, so possible jail time. Just the absolute worst. So what confounds me is, why would you want to make it even worse for me yo, why!?

So I tapered my use down over the course of a week, maybe ten days till I was using miniscule amounts and then quit cold turkey after going to a methodone clinic and not wanting to deal with their bullshit and getting hooked on something even worse. The last time I used was 13 days ago. I get cravings. They're extremely intense sometimes but you'll have resources available to you like NA. I hope the NA near you is like mine and full of understanding people that you can call 24/7 if you're having issues. I actually found a little bit of dope around 1230 last night and just sat there and stared at it for what seemed like hours but was only maybe 45 minutes. I woke my wife up and had her destroy it. I could have gone from 13 days to zero and for what? If you want to be sober you can. Withdrawal sucks even if you taper down, but it doesn't last forever and if you want you only ever have to go through it this once. You don't have to use again. Good luck friend. """""Negative

Well I was about to hop on reddit and decide WHAT THE FUCK should i do? I have NO motivation sober. I hate everyone.

I only make enough to support my drug habit. I cant use other drugs to substitute opiates, weed makes me foggyheaded as all hell and i burns holes in my memory. benzos are addictive and i dont want to physically withdrawal from TWO substances. and i LOVE uppers but ive only used meth ONCE in my life (well actually it was a 3 day bender but that was the first and last time i used meth. loved it too much i knew i had to stay away) and i crave no drug EXCEPT OPIATES. Life doesnt fulfill me but opiates make it bearable and give me a reason to smile. Does anyone TRULY stop craving opiates and enjoy life after quitting? how long does it take? i literally get headaches all day and begin hating myself if i dont do opiates. but when i use opiates i function like a normal person and im even fun to be around (untill i run out). but when im sober all i think about is getting high.

Who wants to spend all their money, stealing from their own family, hanging around on street corners waiting to score in all weathers, in constant conflict with the police.. all just to 'feel well'. There is no great high after a time of abuse either.But no.. we are arresting people who can't stop and most of them whose fault they are in that mess in the first place is that of the doctors and the massive fucking company creaming off the profits from addictive medicine.In a way and this sounds terrible, but perhaps having heroin available (and I don't mean lethal fentanyl) saved peoples lives because they weren't stuck paying ridiculously high prices to doctors and pharmacies for their 'medicine' which makes you feel like you're sick without it. I'm certain there are plenty of people that took what was prescribed, aren't knowledgeable about anything medical and didn't know what the hell was happening to them when they tried to quit.

The money anywhere near illegal drugs is absurd - and its all flowing OUT of our economy (and into the laundromat called HSBC!)-TL;DR-If you feel like this and its only the shame or admitting to someone the point you've reached - get over it. Ask for help. This illness will NOT let you quit by yourself. Every time I go through detox, I feel like I really want it in the beginning. I give my phone, my credit cards, my keys - everything - to the person looking after me. Yet by day 7-10 I'm trying to scam them back off the person to relapse.. despite going through the worst of the withdrawals and being nearly back to normal.

The only thing that worries me about using a tube with foil is leakage and worries about it being too far in to pierce foil. Was that an issue for you?
