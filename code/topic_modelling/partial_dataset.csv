44,"Yes. In 2015, I was dopesick and just moved across the country on my moms dime to detox on her couch. I had no money and no trust. I went on Craigslist and sold a bunch of garbage I found in my old bedroom for 10 bucks. Walked to the store and bought 2 five dollar scratch offs and won 50. Got the money, and then the night before Thanksgiving Eve I texted two women on Backpages in my area that looked like they used. The next morning I got a text back, and she said not only would she do it for me, but she would drop it off right then AND give me a rig. She was there in a half hour, she gave me the shit, and it was the best thanksgiving ever. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. A couple other times she dropped off shit for free, and i got stranded one time with a dead phone and she found me and I drove her car to my house while she put on makeup and haggled with a John.   I ended up selling her piss for her PO which I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be clean or not (I was upfront with her and it was her only chance) and haven‚Äôt heard from her since. She had just done 8 years and I‚Äôm pretty sure she went back. I‚Äôve been clean almost 2 years but just typing that made me vividly remember how that day I went from hopeless to high in about an hour (I was in a strange rural area that I had only lived in for a couple months between semesters years earlier). I remember I dragged a VCR upstairs and watched the flintstones Christmas carol all night.   I ended up meeting the dealer through her and sold his number to tons of internet strangers and it kept me well for months but it was very risky and honestly not cool to the dealer, but I met some righteous people. One dude was so appreciative that he would occasionally text me and tell me to look outside and he would bring me a vacuum sealed bag with a bundle, Xanax, and an eighth. I screwed that up too because when I was sick one time I texted him and said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt bring me more shit I‚Äôll tell the dealer you‚Äôre not cool‚Äù or something like that. Bad times.   Edit for wall of text.  Tldr: I won 50 on a scratch off and had an escort bring me dope to my moms house. """"","Positive"

108,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone will even see this post or take the time to reply to it, but I have asked for help here in the past and always received great advice. I always thought I had hit rock bottom before and truly understood what it meant to be there. When I was an IV heroin addict 3 years ago and was homeless with no place to go, I thought that was my rock bottom. When I relapsed after a year and 4 months sober and lost everything I worked hard to get back in that time in just two weeks I thought I hit rock bottom. I have been clean off opiates for over 6 months now, and 2 months off suboxone. So what‚Äôs the problem you might ask? I tried crack cocaine for the first time 3 weeks ago and have lost complete control of my life. The reason I say I am truly at my lowest point in my life is because I know now it‚Äôs not the material things that you lose or don‚Äôt have anymore. I have worked really hard to get where I am now. I live in a gated community that is 20mins away from the one of the nicest beaches in the east coast, I have a job that I actually enjoy going to work everyday, and most importantly a fucking amazing and supportive girlfriend and group of friends and family. I had to earn a lot of trust back and trust me it took a lot of time. I got hooked on crack when I went to my dealers house to grab some vyvanse and they asked if I messed with it. I had only tried crack three times in my life before then and it was back when I was using heroin and never thought it wasn‚Äôt all that great. Long story short, here I am 3 weeks later and I can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôll get two days sober and then have dreams about it where I can feel like I‚Äôm actually high in my dreams then I wake up craving it. I told my girlfriend and my best friend the truth about everything last weekend, after I had a mental breakdown high off crack and tried to get in a high speed chase I hit 132mph in my mother‚Äôs Mercedes while crying hysterically. I pulled over to the side of the road and just started praying for help. I had 4 days sober after that, then bought a 30 sack after I had a couple drinks at an oyster roast. I know I‚Äôm being so selfish and I know I‚Äôm on the verge of losing everything that I‚Äôve worked so hard for in my life, but I am completely broken. I don‚Äôt even enjoy getting high anymore, all it does is cause me anxiety, but I can‚Äôt fucking stop. On top of it all I have type B strain flu virus, and I know smoking this much is just making me more sick. I know this isn‚Äôt opiate related but if anyone has any experience or advice that would help in anyway it would be so appreciated. Thank you to whoever read this and be safe y‚Äôall.

If you can draw any positives from the resultant deaths of a fentanyl tainted drug supply at the present time, it is that the unprecedented number of overdose deaths it is responsible for has been steering the debate in that direction. Although, on the other hand, fentanyl is quickly becoming the drug of choice for a variety of drug users. In cities where heroin already had a reputation in the inner city, fentanyl is growing in popularity and is being sought out over heroin in some cases. Price, strength, availability and resale potential make it a game changer. With all of this in mind, I feel that the potential for government subsidized opioids; like diacetylmorphine, to make a meaningful difference, lessens with every passing day.

385,"Hey guys,   I have a chronic illness that causes my joints to dislocate frequently. I am in a ton of pain all the time and because of these dislocations, I end up getting major orthopedic surgery very frequently. We are talking 3-7 surgeries every year.  My doctors are very cautious about prescribing me any sort of pain medication (even getting stronger anti-inflammatory medications can be a challenge). However, when I get surgery, I typically get prescriptions for whatever I need. I'm in the military which has random drug tests and I need a recent prescription to be able to keep my job, so this is very important and legality is also an issue.  Here are my biggest issues that I need help with because I can't keep living like this:   1. I have an addictive personality. I can become addicted to random stuff like video games and cake without any issues. I know for sure I would have an alcohol issue, so I just don't keep it around my house. Here's the problem: I get major surgery and get worried I'm going to get addicted. I debate whether or not I should use the pain killers *at all*. Typically, I stop taking them after 48 hours or so, even though I'm in agonizing pain and essentially only sleep when I physically pass out. My doctor asks me to please take the meds for 2 weeks or longer, but in the past, I knew it was going to be a problem MUCH before that  - and I know he wouldn't help me with the aftermath.  How can I conservatively use these medications without causing a ton of issues for me in the future? I mean, there has to be some happy medium between not using them at all and becoming addicted, but I just don't know how to gauge it.  2. When I do take the meds for more than a couple days, I need to be able to work from home because I don't have enough time off work to go to physical therapy and recover. However, I CANNOT for the life of me stay awake for more than a few hours at a time when I take even a basic dose of Percocet. I alternate with an NSAID, but even caffeine can't keep me awake/alert. I only take one pill every 8 hours or so... Any suggestions?  3. Tramadol does nothing for me. At all. No pain relief or anything, which is surprising because other opiates knock me on my ass. Is this common? How do you suggest that I communicate this problem since doctors feel like Tramadol is the only thing that they can safely prescribe WITHOUT sounding like I'm a drug seeker?  4. How do you deal with family and friends that act like you're subhuman for using these medications? If I tell people I can't drink beer because I'm on Percocet, my friends act like I need to go to AA and need an intervention. I can't help but feel dirty when they react this way.  5. Constipation, lack of hunger, and sex drive - any advice here? I sometimes don't eat for 24 hours or longer when I'm on them.  This issue will never go away and will just get worse with time, so I want to be able to have as healthy of a relationship with these meds as possible.  I appreciate your help. """"","Positive"
386,"Take your meds as prescribed and you have a very good chance of NOT becoming addicted. Addiction starts becoming an issue when you are taking beyond what you‚Äôre prescribed, and taking them despite knowing you are causing negative consequences. There is nothing wrong with taking opioids for pain as a doctor prescribes. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre for.   As for getting something other than Tramadol... there‚Äôs tons of stuff on this sub saying ‚ÄúI legit need meds, how do I lie to my doctor to convince him to give them‚Äù. The reality is that if you need them, telling the truth is the best and probably most reliable way to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù them to write for them. Obviously getting controlled substances isn‚Äôt as easy as it once was but not all physicians are heartless and if you tell them honestly that it just doesn‚Äôt work, but that perc‚Äôs knock you out, then they know and can try other options. Perhaps a partial agonist would work, or one of the other many full agonists that are available. Everyone is affected differently and saying tramadol doesn‚Äôt work isn‚Äôt going to immediately be a red flag for abuse, especially if you also tell them that you are not a fan of oxy because it makes you too sleepy. Having that many surgeries a year, you need to find a doctor who to can have a mutual trust with and find something that will work for your lifestyle.   Good luck! """"","Positive"

I've been consistently taking opiates for 4 and a half years up until this point.  Not gonna bore you with my life story but for a little background, at age 14(in 2009) I got drunk for the first time. Two weeks after that I tried adderall. Then xanax. I tried percosets and vicodin at this age too, but didn't really enjoy them that much, they made me throw up mostly and I thought the high was uncomfortable. I fell in love with xanax and was pretty bad on them throughout the rest of high school and beyond. After I graduated, I tried coke, shrooms, molly, ecstasy and drank pretty regularly. In 2013 my mom got diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver(she was an alcoholic my whole life), was given 6 months to live, and was perscribed vicodin, via hospice. I was in such deep pain, I just started taking them. Everyday. It was free, no one noticed any ever went missing, and when the script ran out they were delivered to our door step the next morning, free of charge.  I never liked them until it was the only thing really making me feel slightly okay with having to deal with my mom being terminally ill. So obviously I became mentally and physically dependant on them, she ended up living for a year and two months. I had quit on my own one month prior to her death. The longest I went off of them was 3 months, in 2013/beginning of 2014 (2 months after my mom died) When I relapsed, I tried roxys for the first time. It was a suggestion of my girlfriend at the time, who did roxys years back a lot recreationally. She wanted them for her birthday. I blew my entire tax check on them and the rest is history. I continued to do any type of pill I could get my hands on, or afford. Percs, vics, but I especially loved roxys. As the years when on I got worse and worse on pills and basically all my money went to them. Toward the end of 2017 I tried heroin for the first time. I loved it. I did that for months between pills also. (only snorted heroin, never IVed anything)  And now that leads us to right now. Last Saturday was my first time off pills in my most recent several months binge, and as of right now it's been a full nine days. The first two days were brutal, and I was staying with a friend of mine who helped me through it. She refused to give me xanax or anything but ibuprofen to ease the WDs. At first I was pretty angry about it but in retrospect I'm happy she didn't cause I remember every detail of how awful it was and I'm glad.   I've tried and failed quitting so many times. Never could really go passed 7 days clean. Boredom is my biggest problem sometimes.  Also, this is the first time I've quit for myself.  I'm not in NA, but I've been before and I think I'll try again.  Towards the end I was very suicidal and even with my drugs, I didn't really wanna get out of bed most days. I was sick of myself and what I had become. I was sick of hurting people over the years with my addiction.   I gotta say since the WDs have stopped, I've been so much happier. I haven't felt this generally good in a long time. Without my crutch. I am still mourning it though, I do still crave it, and God do I miss it.   I've been taking it day by day, and I truly do not want to go back to that. I want to continue to be free from its shackles, I've felt like a fucking slave for years, because I have been.  Sorry for the long post..I mostly did this as my own personal therapy, to extract all these thoughts out of my head.  Being off of opiates has so many more pros than cons, I finally wake up and feel normal. I'm not sick, I'm not instantly getting up to pop a pill or snort h, just to feel normal.    If you actually read this, thank you and thank everyone on this sub. I hope everyone stays safe out there, and if you want to quit..it's so fucking worth it.  I hope I never fall back into its clutches. """"","Positive"

So if you have found something that works for you, then keep doing it. Anyone in the program of recovery that looks down on you for seeking and working towards a manageable life (while using Suboxone or anything else) is failing to see the truth... They are searching for the same thing, a life worth living where they don't burn everything down. In fact, most of them probably came in the rooms high as a fucking kite. How are they better than you?  I understand that for most addicts, using any MAS is dangerous territory. It would be for me. However, I have three words that really ring true. Love the haters. Love them, by not giving a fuck about their judgment.  Anyways, I love you family. Who gives a fuck about you being on box.

1485,"For those that ask, have you checked the search bar for what real ones should look like?  Call me crazy, but I feel like someone has come up with the idea of creating the guide of all guides to identify legit pills.  I could be wrong though.  All I'm saying is the general manner in which these posts are made are incredibly inefficient.  They may as well be spam at this point.  First off, any pill has the potential to be duplicated well enough to fool a trained eye.  It would actually be hazardous for someone to suggest your pill is legitimate just by looks alone.  We could only say in full faith that what you have is a real pill is if it were reagent tested, or straight from the pharmacy.  Also, not to mention most of the pictures users submit are blurry as shit, poorly lit, only a single side, etc.  The lack of elaboration on the pills other characteristics also prevents a more educated _guess_.    So, I haven't looked myself because it wouldn't make sense for me to as a heroin  user, but if such a guide does not exist, we should put a comprehensive list of all available pills and make it a rule for users to check the list before making yet another redundant (or will be redundant when the guide is available) post on the subject.    Another benefit would be that misinformation would less likely occur.  The guide could be revised, thus making it more trustworthy.  I've done a little bit of meth earlier, so this is just my two cents.  Of course still ask us if someone is unsure, but I'm sure the amount of these types of posts would be greatly reduced.

Most of the pills look like an old Nokia Brick burner phone took the picture, and even google images and pill identification sites have off photos sometimes.

I'm guessing California is quite similar. Both of these stares have the heroin scene controlled by the cartels. I never hear about cartels pushing out powder heroin, it's always tar with those guys.   I actually really miss the super great BTH I could get in Texas. The high seemed to be much more of a full body high, due to the different alkaloid content in the BTH. Powder always felt like it was much more of a head high, but with the body rush if you IV. I was getting great ECP when I lived in SC. It was $80/half or $150/G. If I could get either one of those right now, I would go for the gram of the BTH, as long as I could get the same quality I used to. With tar it could vary so wildly with the potency. Well, all heroin was like that. But it seemed like tar had more of problem with it. I haven't used powder heroin in about two years. And at the end of my run with it, I had very consistent connects whom I have known for years. Their quality was always super consistent.  Shit I don't even remember where I was going with this. But the tar certainly did do a number on my veins.. 8 months or so, and it did more damage than 4 years doing IV ECP. """"","Positive"

It has been associated with necrotizing fasciitis, wound botulism, increased vein wall scarring and hardening, and many other problems due to the unclean environment it is synthesized in. The impure nature of the drug also leads to many things being left in it, like plant matter and other really shitty cuts, like shoe polish, coffee, and cola. The pH is often much lower than powdered heroin as well, making it much more acidic. I am sure there are many other reasons, but those are the ones on the top of my head. """"","Positive"

The work is always changing, and the higher paying jobs go quick, so the more time your online, the more likely you'll be to make money.

Our major concerns at this current time are sourcing and locations issues, these have been identified as *the* reasons that these other subreddits have been shut down.

I am going to clearly define when you can post something about your location.  * **Countries** are always acceptable to speak about.  * **Large regions** are always okay. e.g. Great Lakes, New England, southwest.  * **States** are *not* acceptable when talking about dope porn or not being able to find a connect. They are okay when talking about harm reduction issues or very general topics.  * **Cities** are **never** allowed unless it is a fentanyl warning, the post will then be moderated accordingly.  * **Streets** are **never** acceptable.  * **Neighborhoods** are **never** acceptable.  * **GPS coordinates** - you work for the NSA and you are a cop, never acceptable.  -----  **Sourcing**  From the sidebar:  > No sourcing! Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, including other subreddit members, online markets, and/or vendors. Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued.   I feel like that is very clear.

There is the report button that is below every post and below every comment, please use it when necessary. We have many systems in place to help us deal with these problems, but we don't see everything.  People that break the rules will be dealt with accordingly.

1856,"I think it would take a massive shift in our culture. There is a huge link between childhood abuse and addiction. So we are treating a lot of traumatized people like criminals to begin with. Decriminalization of drugs would help with safe places to use, where they also could have help and info for those that want to quit.  A lot of people treat their mental illness with illegal drugs. Making healthcare a right and not a privilege, and actually funding and improving mental healthcare in this country would help I think.  There have been studies done on mice that show when they are in bleak, boring cages they will use more opiates than if they are placed in cages with interesting things to do. I'm not really sure how to translate this to the real world, but in my opinion, our society has this unhealthy view that your right to exist in this society is dependent on what kind of work you do and how much money you make. I think we take individualism and bootstrappiness too far and that's not how humans are meant to live.

I believe medical marijuana is a step in the right direction as far as treating pain and keeping people from getting a bunch of opioid scripts, giving access to millions of people.   As far as addressing the fentanyl epidemic associated with the overall opioid epidemic: this is going to be a global problem. Control of precursors, getting China to *actually* regulate their chemistry industry, advanced package screen at customs, and fucking instituting a halfway decent maintenance program for people that want to get off opioids in the first place.

Users would be more accepted by society in the sense that if they wish to seek help, they don't have to be scared or embarrassed.  This would also allow ignorance to be overcome, leading to a more informed society.  A mindset not based on ignorance will allow individuals to use better judgement.  Gangs, cartel, and terrorist groups would be less likely to profit from illegal drug sales.  This would decrease violence and crime worldwide.  Children would be less likely to be tempted to try drugs at a young age without the pressure from 'evil influence'.    It's a no brainier to me....  But then again, ...

2064,"No bro go ahead and put me on the spot, you're giving a question I need to have an answer for.   My arrest was in October, multiple felonies hanging over my head. Though slightly off track but still good to note, the arresting officer never put my case in for filing. I called 4 different 3rd party attorneys, all of which said this is astronomical and if it hasn't been filed already, it likely won't be. So play safe and stay put for one year waiting for a court date, if late October comes but the court date hasn't they say I should be fine to live out of county.   Today is 4 months clean off heroin. I'm around it all the time so I don't know how but I'm still holding strong. Behavioral patterns and routines are largely based on environment, i.e. geographical location. To establish new patterns and routines seems more realistic in my eyes than completely revamping, turn 180, what's already established and reinforced over several years of being in that way of operating. But I don't really think that's an excuse. I don't know. Every addict that I know that has been successful in recovery, and by that I mean has a true blue honest chance at being one of the ones that makes it, they all moved.   Awhile back I got a job, made a post on here about it. I was fuckin thrilled because I didn't have to be on the streets to make money anymore, so one less thing holding me there. My buddy who got me the job laid out a whole plan of how us working together will lead us to an apartment together, healthy life, etc. 3 days in I injured my shoulder outside of work and lost the job. This was in December. Still have to make ends meet whether I have a job or not, and Doctors state no working until further notice. So I don't have a lot of options. Any kind of assistance program takes months to go through and I don't have that kind of time.   I'm sorry for the ramble, it's not something I've figured out yet honestly. Point is I don't want to be out here selling hard drugs and going through everything that comes with it, I had a great chance at getting away from it and I literally slipped on ice and was sent right back out here. Legal revenue or not, I have to survive until October so I can get the fuck out of these 2 counties.  Work on getting my head ready for that transition in the mean time.  """"","Positive"

And in Europe, I do not think there even is pills of Hydrocodone, Oxymorphone or Hydromorphone.  As for snorting - it is somewhat of a waste. It has a lower BA than oral (75-80% vs like 95%) and it does not last as long. But I always liked it - faster and stronger comeup.

Our house has an alley behind it, and there‚Äôs a house that‚Äôs caddy corner from our driveway. The caddy corner house shields our driveway from the road. Well, I guess two people decided our driveway would be the perfect place to shoot up.   Now, onto the situation. My husband was taking our dog outside, and he saw the car. The car was off, so my husband walked up to it. While walking up to the car, he noticed cigarette butts which he took to mean they‚Äôd been there for a while. Inside, he saw two men sleeping. The driver was bleeding from three different pricks in his arm. My husband tried to wake up the driver, and he would not wake up. The driver only woke up after my husband had our dog bark. The driver woke up, turned the car on, and sped off.   What are we supposed to do in situations like this? It‚Äôs disrespectful among many other things. How is this fair to us to walk outside and see this? I do feel sorry for guys needing their fix THAT bad, but come on... This whole thing is just scary.  """"","Positive"

If they have kids, have a job, are the sole bread winner for the family etc not knowing who, if any people heavily depend on them addiction or not. But if for some odd reason the same guys, or other new people end up in your driveway doing the same thing and you catch and see them, I'd just try to approach with as much understanding as you can muster and without anger just explain that you can't have this going on on your property and make it known that after this time if you catch them again, THEN there will be legal repercussions going forward.

2420,"My advice is to cold cop. Here‚Äôs something I typed for another user:    Cold Cop Guide, written by u/schizoidparanoid   Try the poorer areas of wherever you live, or even the ghetto if you have one. You can look for busy street corners and try to wave down a corner boy/dealer to buy - sometimes there‚Äôs multiple corner boys.  The best option is probably to talk to ‚Äújunkie‚Äù-looking homeless people. It helps a lot if you give the homeless person money when you ask them if they know where to get heroin - it builds their trust that you‚Äôre not a cop/really looking to score dope/they now have money and are happy and more likely to help you out. Tell them that you‚Äôll either give them more cash (probably about $5-$10) or you‚Äôll break off a little (about a point - .1g) of dope if they‚Äôre able to help you and they can successfully score you some dope immediately.   Make damn sure that you NEVER let your money walk. It will NOT come back - probably 70-90% of the time your money leaves your sight, it‚Äôs not coming back, and neither is that ‚Äúcorner boy‚Äù/‚Äúdealer‚Äù or that homeless junkie... If the person says they have to walk around the block or anything like that to go pick it up, if you can‚Äôt walk right alongside with them, then find someone else to help you score dope. There‚Äôs always another corner boy/junkie - there‚Äôs not more money.  In some areas of the country, legit corner boys will sometimes offer you a ‚Äútester‚Äù of their dope because you‚Äôre a new face and a new potential repeat customer. The tester is almost always just a small amount of dope - maybe a half a point to .15 grams. Occasionally, these tester bags will be (sometimes significantly) stronger than the dope they normally sell, to make you think they consistently sell straight fire dope and make you want to come back. Sometimes, they even mix/use 100% Fentanyl in the tester bags since it‚Äôs cheaper and so goddamn much stronger than actual pure heroin. So be sure to be extra careful when doing a tester bag (and also when doing any dope from a new dealer). Do very small test bumps/shots. You can always do more, but you can never do less. Be smart/safe...   *If you have any other questions, feel free to reply or PM me. I‚Äôll answer any other questions you have to the best of my knowledge.*   TL;DR - Try poor areas/the ghetto. Look for corner boys/Selena on busy street corners. Pay $5-$10 to/break off a point for ‚Äújunkie‚Äù-looking homeless people to help you score dope. Corner boys/dealers may offer you a ‚Äútester‚Äù bag since you‚Äôre a new, potential repeat customer - these testers are sometimes much stronger to make you think they have fire dope consistently, and are sometimes even laced with/completely Fent. Do very small test bumps/shots with testers or any dope you‚Äôve never tried before from a new dealer.  """"","Positive"

2778,"I started using drugs 'later' than most kids.  Smoked weed for the first time when I was 17...  Actually, it all began then: first time drunk, started fucking around with OTC drugs, blah blah.  Before I turned 19, I'd already tried most mainstream drugs: LSD, MDMA, coke, benzos, various opies, etc.  Nothing was really taking over my life at this point.    Fast forward to 23, a couple years of partying pretty frequently and still dabbling, smoking weed, etc.  I started doing Roxy 30's like.,...  Once every month or two.  No big deal.  They were pretty expensive.  I'd take 2 at a time, would get pretty high but not worth $60.  Eventually, I'm talking to a co-worker and heroin comes up.  I was already interested.  I bought two bags and went straight home. I didn't do them right away.  I hesitated for a little until i finally went and did a pretty small bump...  Well, barely even a bump.  I was fucking DESTROYED.  I had never been so fucked in my whole life.   The next day I was so sick.  I had the most brutal headache, my face lolwas pale as shit, and I was puking up straight bile.  That was such a fucked experience, but even so, I still ended up doing the rest of those bags.    Fast forward a couple months or so: I got promoted at work and was making decent money.  It involved me travelling to Florida for a week and a half 2 or so times a month.  When I would come home, my dude and I would smoke some weed and snort some bags.  I started to noticed how my stamina and confidence in general had improved while I was high.  My use was still pretty limited since I was away from home a bit, and at this point I wasn't physically addicted.    A few more months go by, and I miss my first flight.  It wasn't directly related to my use, but I was definitely high at the time.  At this moment in time: my friend was hustling and would hook it up with a bun every time he went up (3-4 times a week give or take), I put in my two weeks with my current place and was ready to start work elsewhere, I was about to move in with my hustler friend and his brother, and I was just about to start IVing.    So, I've been working at the new place, I'm doing 10 bag shots and going through 50+ bags every day and a half.  I was still doing pretty decent even with my habit. Shit was mostly cool.  My hustler friend's brother and I were best friends before moving in, but he was being quite an ass hole......   Wait, this story was about how we got into it....  I'm well past that at this point.

2850,"I haven‚Äôt told this to **anyone** yet, maybe some of you can give me some insight. I‚Äôve been floating around this sub for almost a year. I‚Äôm not a huge poster or commenter, but a few of you may remember me as the chick that has been on dialysis forever, opiates even longer, have myself endocarditis from shooting into my dialysis fistula and now my husband keeps my med looked in a safe. He gives them out daily and I save my roxys and Xtampzas up for a week and have happy time on weekends (I don‚Äôt shoot anymore).   I was finally put on the transplant list a month ago after being on dialysis for eight years. I had hoped to have my surgery by the end of this year. That‚Äôs why I was shocked to get a call yesterday from my coordinator saying they had a possible match. I was surprised it was so fast, but so happy. Then she told me the kidney was from a young adult, was a match for my blood type and the person had never had any major illnesses or surgeries. It sounded good. Then, the coordinator said ‚ÄúThe kidney cannot be classified as completely healthy. The person was exposed to HIV and/or Hep‚Äù. She told me they had run and rerun several tests and they had come back negative. It was showing that it was perfectly healthy. But, it couldn‚Äôt be listed as healthy. I turned it down and began the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù and the ‚Äúwas I right?‚Äù    I knew that because I had only been on the transplant list for a month that I was not the first (or probably in the first 20) person they called. The more I thought about it, the more things I realized.   The donor was a very young adult and the coordinator said that the kidney had not been in any major accidents (of course she couldn‚Äôt specify and probably shouldn‚Äôt have even told me that). But, the HIV/Hep designation would come from IV drug use. And then, because I knew the donor was not living, I realized that this was most likely an OD. I called my Nephrologist‚Äôs office and spoke to his nurse. She said that I was probably going to get many calls about potential matches with HIV/Hep kidneys from OD‚Äôs and that I needed to wait for a healthy kidney. She said the numbers of these types of donor kidneys (OD khave gone steadily up over the past five years. She told me that it would not be held against me to pass on these types of kidneys, especially because I am young and even the healthiest in transplanted kidneys only last for 20 years at the most.   Last night I began to feel awful. This young person had made the decision to give the most wonderful gift of organ donation. Or, this person‚Äôs heart broken parents made an incredible choice to donate their son‚Äôs or daughter‚Äôs organs. Either way, the family wanted to help another person have a new life through this amazing sacrifice. And now, so many of us were turning it down.   I never knew this person, I knew nothing about them. But I found myself thinking about what kind of life they had. What kind of things did they like? What kind of music, movies and food? Why did they start shooting? Were the alone and sad? My heart was heavy because I wished I could thank them for their incredible donation. I wanted to tell the family what a wonderful and brave gift they had given. I actually began to cry when I thought about the mom (I‚Äôm a mom myself and I couldn‚Äôt imagine how hard this must be) and Dad must be going through. üòî  Although the situation surrounding the death of this young person might be something other than an OD from IV drugs, it‚Äôs unlikely after putting together all the facts. I will get many potential matches from OD deaths. It is heartbreaking to me. I just want everyone to stay safe, keep narcan on hand, and party with a buddy. This sub is awesome! """"","Positive"

I've read some of you're post history and you seem like a vibrant lovely human with a lot of life left to live. I have flown hearts, lungs, kidneys, livers up to 450 miles to get a transplant. I assure you this person's body was treated with respect, reverence, and true care. The gift of life is an amazing sacrifice to give and such a wonderful thing. You are correct due to OD, and anxious events a lot of organs from younger healthy people are popping up but the risk of HIV/Hep b/c is rather high. Hep C can now be cured but I'm not sure how that would work for a transplant patient, I would assume it would not be allowed due to working the kidneys into overtime.   I want you to know you're not alone, and that being there a bunch, being in the room with an OD, trying my hardest to save them, and ultimately losing them is taken very hard by us.

I moved to Ukraine from the good Ol' USA a few years ago, just to get away from it all basically live a simple, work free life on the gov't check I was getting. So let me set the stage for you all.  I'm Hetmen. Ex-American soldier, who moved to his mothers homeland of Ukraine. I have quite a bit of family here and spend almost all my time with them. Typically they spend 3 to 6 months in a western country working construction (men) or as a nanny/live in nurse (women) then come back for about 6 months before they take off again. Me? I just drink and use everyday, babysit for family, help in the garden...basically chill.   So my cousin, Oleg, gets this idea, he decides hes gonna rent out a little place, buy some video gambling machines and start a business..... As you can expect, the business doesn't work out on account of the fact that people have no fucking money to gamble with. Ahhhh, but where did Oleg get the start up money from? None other then the Ukrainian Mafia. I figure this is not my or my family's problem, surely Oleg will figure it out. Well, Oleg suddenly goes to Prague to work (this was over 3 years ago).   A few month go by and I'm at my other cousin Lana's house just crushing some vareniki in her apartment when we hear the buzzer on her door go off. She picks up the phone to see who it is and a look of fear washes over her face. She says its the mafia guys looking for Oleg. She tells me they've come twice now looking for him.   Me, being pretty high, drunk and full of dumplings, say I'll go down to talk to them. So I walk down to the entrance of her building and there are two normal looking guys in their mid twenties.

3007,"I basically agree with this (as long as you aren't IVing the dope) but it's much harder to manage your tolerance with dope.

So it is hard to know how fast your tolerance is rising -- with (real) pain pills if my tolerance is going up too fast I can catch it before things spiral out of control and dial my doses back. Much harder to do with dope, because there are no standard doses or potency.

That's why the prices are like $25-40 for a bun imo, since the actual amount total is prob less than a half gram. In other places like philly, they cost more, BUT not only contain usually a little bit more dope per bag (they're supposed to contain 0.1g per bag but I'm pretty sure are usually short), and can sometimes come with 13-14 instead of just 10 bags, although I'm pretty sure the majority of places that deal in bundles/stamps have 10 as the standard bundle amount. But considering they can contain upwards of twice as much dope as you'd get with a $25 bun, it's typically worth it for those users.  I hope this helps.

I went a month without weighing myself and using daily,  thinking I‚Äôll see a low number once I do..I didn‚Äôt lose anything,  heart crushed..major disappointment.

3137,"If you are addicted to opioids and not losing weight despite not eating much food it is probably because you are at the point where your metabolism has adapted to your caloric intake and lifestyle by slowing down.  The same thing happens in a crash diet.  Look up reverse dieting.  In the long run the goal is to increase your metabolism by lifting weights/building muscle/doing cardio, and ACTUALLY EATING MORE FOOD.  People that normally crash diet on 1000-1500cal per day and aren‚Äôt losing weight that correctly reverse diet/exercise can end up eating 2500cal per day AND still lose fat.  The scale may not change much, but that‚Äôs because they are building muscle/losing fat so the body composition changes, and not the weight.  Opioid addiction obviously doesn‚Äôt help in the exercise/eating department either, and if you are an addict the risk of you developing an eating disorder is VERY HIGH. Constantly lowering calories is not the answer.

Race is for the most part an appearance trait, racism is completely flawed. Someone will have their car broken into by a white dude and not bat an eyelid, a black dude does it and suddenly ALL black people are vilified.. instead of the rightful POOR people, who unfortunately have to do these kinds of things(not that they should be vilified I'm just saying)...   I mean, come the fuck on, we need to stop dividing ourselves. We need to come together as humans.

They created a unique culture in the US which has contributed significantly to American culture as a whole.  I don't understand how some people don't understand this.

3165,"As long as there are people deriving their whole worldview from wrong assumptions, those people will do the most amazing gymnastics before questioning their beliefs. Imho the only way to combat ignorance is critical thinking. If the bullshit tolerance is kept low from a young age, there won't be room for racism, discrimination in general or shit like conspiracy theories... Critical thinking is a skill that can be learned.     But just imagine you've been building your identity, your self esteem and the admiration for important people in your life on the belief that white > dark. If you come along and question this basic belief, the person will have the diffuse feeling that not only this  belief is challenged, but also everything that's important to their person. So they reflexively get defensive. At that time they don't know that the things that matter won't crumble just because they admit that they were wrong on that issue. Relationships and loved ones usually remain.    Plus, if everyone believes something, it must be right is a common bias. People that criticize those beliefs aren't considered people, so everyone who is considered a human being of the same worth confirms the beliefs. That way there is no need to go through the uneasy and painful process of taking a critical look on your core beliefs.     That's why we still have racism in 2018. People need to be educated and taught how to ask the right questions.  """"","Positive"

Tell me what you think of the poem at the end, I‚Äôm genuinely interested in feed back.   I made all the classic mistakes, I let my money walk, I let my CAR walk at one point (it did come back though), I trusted the strange dude who my middle introduced me to instead of her when I knew she could be trusted. I bought his uncle beer? And then rented a room in my name that he barely used? He kept disappearing or sending me to go get someone instead of getting down to business which should have been obviously shady. He made himself out to be a trustworthy dude but he kept trying to make me doubt my middle (call her K), should have been wary of that. Everything took like 3 or more hours to get nothing done. Wasted a lot of gas and in the end I had no choice but to go home, leaving him with the money and her screwed over because she was gonna use the money I gave her for all this to flip some shit and make her way back home to Cali to see he husband. She showed me a picture of him. I know she‚Äôs trustworthy, she was dragging me all over the place trying to find them and my money before I had to go. She wanted to kill them. She was crying because she was screwed now but also in a mothering way because  I hadn‚Äôt listened and got fucked over. I set her up in the room the guy had me rent for the night though, got a new key. I gave her the cash I had left save what I needed for tolls to get home. She had taken the guys laptop as collateral against anything happening to me at one point, which has me concerned for her safety, though I didn‚Äôt get the impression these people were violent and she‚Äôs been homeless for like 10 years so she‚Äôs street smart but still. I told her to try and trade the laptop for the drugs and fuck it she can have half of them, but only if it wasn‚Äôt putting her in danger, otherwise she should just give it back, I don‚Äôt care about the money or the drugs at this point, just that she‚Äôs safe. I‚Äôm gonna try and help her get across country in time to see her husband for his birthday. I‚Äôm gonna buy her a below freezing sleeping bag that she needs. She read my palm and told me I‚Äôm very creative but that I don‚Äôt use it enough, I have a strong work ethic but I don‚Äôt apply it to my hobbies, that I‚Äôve had some trauma and it affected me greatly and that I have a complicated life, all true things. She said I was a pretty man, with a kick ass beard. People compliment my beard all the time but no ones ever called me pretty. I showed her the text I had gotten the night before from the woman I‚Äôm in love with who told me clearly, that though she values our friendship a lot, in the end the only people she ‚Äòneeds‚Äô are her husband and daughter, things I already knew deep down but didn‚Äôt want to admit to myself. She was sympathetic, and she advised I distance myself from her which is going to be so hard. She gave me a little gold plate of mother Mary for good luck even though she wasn‚Äôt Christian and I wasn‚Äôt catholic but we both agreed on the same opinion regarding organized religion. We also both learned our favorite candy is sour patch kids, go figure. She says we‚Äôre gonna be good friends, something she doesn‚Äôt really even believe in. I told her I believe in true friends but not that everyone will find true love, which she does believe because she has found it. We‚Äôre gonna be good friends.

More than anything they are happy I‚Äôm safe but there‚Äôs gonna be consequences, I don‚Äôt know what.

The tin man was a fool: From before the fall, it is that holy feeling we all search for; the orgasm in slow motion, the sunrise that brings light to the dark places and sends the shadows into retreat. Reminiscent of that moment before dawn, when everything was new. It is fragrant with memories of that last picnic, when you, your mother, and your father were together as one for the last time, when you needn‚Äôt ask, nor be told, you simply knew; you were loved. It is the word that has a name but that for the life of you, you cannot remember. It takes you back to when you did, and you can almost recall, but then you forget you ever cared. It is a pensive bliss, a forlorn glee. It is the tides‚Äô gentle lapping at your toes, lazily kissing more and more of you until your every fiber is graced by its warmth and your entirety is submerged in the sea of sedation. It is a tranquilizing nostalgia, a paralyzing peace; a perfect calm and quiet rest, such that you dare not move, lest you disturb the stillness, the innocence. But you haven‚Äôt any cause to move, for everything is as it should be; as though the caretaker of your heart has flipped the breaker to every frayed and sparking nerve keeping you awake to the pain of this world, closed the blinds, and turned out the lights that you may sleep now for the first time in years. It is as though a divine hand has clasped hold of the soul you let slip from your grasp that it may be spared the harshness below. You may rest without worry, for you have no need of love. Neither to or to be. Without risk there is no reward and you will take the participation ribbon for no reward is worth the risk. The tin man was a fool. Isolated and immune, you are Only; this flower coated armor your best and only friend. Empty; you will outgrow it. What then? In the interim, sleep long and breath easy; you are loved, though you do not care to know it.    """"","Positive"

3281,"Yea I mean you never seem to have had a horribly high tolerance to begin with.  I can only speak from experience and the longer I've stayed in this cycle, every time I got back regardless of how long my break was, my tolerance goes back to what it was faster and faster. """"","Positive"

""""","Positive"
3284,"In my experience your tolerance will be back to how it was before your month break in a week or less depending on how hard you hit it.  At the end of a binge I can be eating 120mg of oxy PO/IN per day, 30-40mg of opana IN per day, or 0.5g H per day depending on what‚Äôs available.  When I take 2-4 weeks off i will get nice and high from 30mg of oxy.  By the third day I will already be taking 60mg, and within a week 90mg will get me high, but the magic that I felt with the initial 30mg dose will already be gone.  It also depends on how long you have been on this opioid rollercoaster.  The more times you have withdrawn from opioids the faster you will adapt to them.  Also, many people report that within a week or two the tolerance will actually become HIGHER than previously, which means that most feel like after a week they are basically back to where they started and then some.  Break the cycle while there is still a chance.  The only time my tolerance has reset to a point where I didn‚Äôt come back that quickly was after taking like 1-5 years off (I have been clean for extended periods of time as well).  I used to IV heroin, and after a 5 year break 15mg of hydrocodone had me FUCKED.  Then I went another year clean after that script was gone, and my next script of oxy syrup had the same effect.  5-15mg would get me wrecked, and even after using the oxy syrup for 2 weeks and never needing to go above 40mg in a dose I barely had any noticeable withdrawal.  It takes A LOT of time to get back to baseline. """"","Positive"
3285,"Just to clarify.  Your tolerance does significantly go down with even 1 week off.  The first dose after a break is always the best, but ALSO THE MOST DANGEROUS.  This is how people die.  The tolerance goes down fast, but what I was trying to point out more is that the tolerance comes back faster. """"","Positive"
3286,"Yes.  The lower your tolerance the longer it will take to build back.  With your current use your best bet is to stick to a 1-2 times per week frequency if you do not want your tolerance to creep back up quickly.  This will also allow you to avoid physical dependency and addiction.  Every now and then take 2 weeks off, and always be careful with your first dose back.  You can always take more but never less.  What I am describing is what most user strive for, but we just can‚Äôt do it.  Daily use is almost inevitable if you have already gone through a real detox.  Good luck. """"","Positive"

Plan this a long way ahead, book 3-4 days off that lead into a weekend (even better if it's a bank holiday).   2. Stock up on comfort drugs a good way before you kick, the last thing you want is to be scrambling around 10 hours into kicking.   3. Break into the comfort meds before you kick - it's been a long day, you've earned some valium on top of your normal dose.   4. Take all of your comfort meds.   5. Buy more.   6. Repeat steps 3-5 until you get to your time off.   7. Rather than having your last dose the night before so that day 1 of your holidays is day 1 of detox, spend the first day getting high as fuck - it's going to be your last session after all!   8. You've got a bit more left than you thought, better finish that on day 2.   9. You just won some money / it's your birthday / you aced that test / you noticed the sky is a particularly lovely shade of blue, reward yourself with 1 more day of using.   10. Realise you now don't have time to kick, so spend the last 2-3 days binging on the last of your comfort meds + whatever you usually use.   11. Rinse and repeat these steps every 6-12 months.

3299,"It depends on the job you are doing and the intensity of the withdrawals.  In my current job It would be dangerous for me to show up to work under the influence or detoxing as I can injure others.  This along with the threat of random urinalysis keeps me in chipping mode.  My profession does not take kindly to illicit opioid use, and even people in recovery on prescribed buprenorphine can be fired.  If you have a job where you do not need to be around people you can lock yourself in your office or cubicle and ride it out, but it is going to be hard.  I would suggest dosing Kratom before and during work to at least get some relief, and to make sure that you look your best.  Shave, shower, style your hair, be hygienic in general, and do what you need to do to seem as normal as possible.  If I were you, and assuming you work M-F I would plan day one to be on Friday since Friday‚Äôs can be pretty relaxed at some jobs, and then you will be off of work for the two worst days, which are normally days 2-3 for me.  Monday back to work will be hit or miss depending on your DOC and intensity of WD, and by Tuesday day 5 you should be able to hide most of the symptoms from coworkers.

I was driving around doing errands and looked around and thought how shit just felt ‚Äúon‚Äù to me that day. What better opportunity to try and find a new connect - my current ones were so bad in quality and unreliable it was really grinding on me. I do better cold copping when I‚Äôm not desperate so I felt like the stars were aligning and all.  So I decided it was a brand new sunny day and I was gonna go for it. I came up on a busy intersection and saw some guys flying flags. One guy‚Äôs said something like ‚Äúgive this cracker some cheese!‚Äù Okay, I can work with that. I pulled around the corner, parked and went back on foot to talk to the guy. Gave him a couple bucks and said if he could help me out with scoring a little shama-lama-dingding to brighten my day that I would make it worth his while. Yes I actually said that.   It was so funny because up until that moment, I honestly thought he was mentally disabled or really fucked up - he had this goofy face on. Was talking all ‚Äúduh duh duh‚Äù ... Tall skinny beardy guy. But his demeanor changed as soon as I mentioned hooking him up and he started talking like a regular person. He was all business. My SO was with me too, and we basically convinced him we‚Äôd take care of him. He did not want to lose his corner spot but decided that a bird in the hand, etc etc. So he grumbled into our car and off we went.  So we drive - ironically enough - back to my neighborhood (I live in the hood) then a little further out past where I typically go to score or pick up. Sure enough he does the deal, he hooks us up, we hook him up. Then we drop him back at his spot. He had a phone so I got his number.  Turns out he did the same kind of work I did. He had lost his job, and with the addiction issue, ended up living out of his car. He was a total hustler. I stayed in touch for awhile - did a bunch of deals with him, always broke him off something. In time he tried to take advantage of my kindness and got greedy, I cut him off. Before that happened, he had introduced us to his main plug, who lived right up the street from me.   The plug worked out of this trap house and had amazing amazing dope on the regular. Omg so good. I was in junkie heaven for months. Until the damn cops raided the place. Then the plug started really having a hard time and doing shady shit. It went downhill quick, and what happened later on is a whole nother story. Suffice to say I ended up with several good plugs, and almost got a street bounty on my head by the time it was all said and done. And it‚Äôs worth mentioning that the original guy I picked up turned up on Reddit front page with another really funny sign. He definitely had a knack for making good signs.

I'm putting all types of barriers between me and the block but reality is daily I still want to get high and it's a struggle.  I'm losing and have lost all the things that really matter to me.  Deep down I do want to stay clean it's just the daily struggle that trips me up.  Anyway if you're withdrawaling now or in the early days/months of recovery it could always be worse.  Story goes like this...I had recently been arrested, lost like my 8th apartment and was stuck moving back in with my folks who were still together at the time for like the tenth time in a 6-7 years.  My dad's the controlling type but really cares and what's to find whatever would work for me.  Now I had been on n off the Vivitrol shot for a couple years at this point.  Before this latest attempt at getting clean my parents said I wasn't living there unless I was on it.  So not being built for hovering over candles in the bando (I've been there too) I agreed.  I was on a pretty vicious year or so long run at this point.  I agreed to check in to detox and thought I'd be fine with just that cuz my family was going to the shore the following week.  That week-10 days would get the methadone taper out of my system and be good for the shot.  Well instead of staying clean that week I decided to drive to Kensington every single day to get high and came back to the shore like nothing happened.  I did this for the next seven days.  On the day of the shot my ex and I drove separate from my dad back home to get the shot.  He had to witness me get it or wouldn't believe me.  So I figured this is gonna suck but I don't wanna be homeless I'm gonna get it regardless.  Then as we're driving down the expressway I thought hell I got high the past 7 days what's the difference if I get high 45 minutes before this thing, might as well relax till I get there.  So I lost my dad in traffic stopped in the hood, got high and proceeded to the office, arriving like ten minutes after my dad.  I went in pissed hot, they made me sign a waiver saying I was gonna get really sick.  I signed it and got the shot.  Worst mistake of my life.  People talk about precipitated withdrawal from subs, I've been there, it's that times 1000.  I got five minutes from the office with my girl driving and instantly started throwing up till it was bile then dry heaving.  My anxiety and hot n cold sweats were so bad I was kicking the windshield.  I never contemplated suicide till that moment.  I almost threw myself into traffic.

Well, recovery took about 3 months longer than expected, and it only helped my pain about 50% (was supposed to completely eliminate the pain).  My doctor continued to prescribe Norco for me at my request.  I was taking up to 40mg a day for the back pain, and a yet-undiagnosed condition, possibly fibromyalgia.  I NEVER took it to get high.  I only took the minimum to control the pain.  I started getting worried when I would take 10mg, and that didn't help, then another 10mg about 45 min later, and STILL it wasn't helping.  I knew my body was building up a tolerance and that road wasn't going to end well.    I SLOWLY tapered and took my last 10mg almost exactly a week ago.  I was able to increase the gabapentin with doctor approval and the transition has been relatively lower pain than expected.  The pain has spiked really bad several times over the last week.

Read a couple articles on it and what I got was basically you get checked into a hospital, go under anesthesia, get injected with naltrexone, and wake up on the other side of withdrawals. What???? How have I never heard about this. I looked it up to see if anywhere in Canada offers if and it costs $4000 at a place in Toronto.  This seems ideal considering the initial WD's are intolerable for a lot of people. They expect you follow up with addressing other issues.   This seems like a \quick fix\"" to WD (not PAWS) or at least a quick tolerance reset. Am I missing something? And has anyone ever done this \""Rapid Detox\""??? If so what was your experience?

After I was finally able to get some sleep I woke up feeling pretty great actually with some lingering minor withdrawal symptoms but nothing close to what I was experiencing the day before.

So, I live in the dense urban core of large PNW city--it's one of the three highest crime neighborhoods in the city, although of course it doesn't hold a candle to anywhere like Detroit or Chicago.   My apartment is in kind of an odd setup--there's a normal small 8 unit apartment building at the streetfront and I live on the first floor of a two family house that is built onto the back of that building (or, maybe our house came first? who knows!). The upstairs apartment has access to the larger building, but we don't--we need to go down a walkway next to the front building and then into the backyard to get to our door.   Our walkway borders the side and back of a large apartment building and its back driveway, which is at the corner of my street and one of our cross streets, and on the edge of our backyard, there's a largeish shed with a tangle of trees and shrubs around it. There's always been a problem with people cutting through our walkway and backyard, as well as the neighboring building's back driveway, to get to the other street, and, in the summer in particular,  hanging out around the shed and the driveway/outdoor stairwells of the large building next door to drink, smoke, camp out even, and, of course, shoot up.  I've never called the cops on anyone, although I will yell at people to leave when they wake me up (my bedroom window is right on the walkway, with five giant recycling bins under it; people sometimes go through them) but my building manager, whose apartment is above mine in the weird tacked on house, gets really het up about this stuff. Today, he saw two guys shooting up behind the shed and called the police.  Unknowingly, on my way home from work, I had arranged for the d boy to swing by, who is super prompt for the first time ever, of-fucking-course. He pulls up as the po-po are fucking arresting one of the poor schmucks from behind the shed (the other guy got away, I guess). We swing around the block  to make the handoff, instead of our usual me jumping in and out of the car, and he brings me back. As I'm strolling back down the walkway to my apt, trying really hard to look like I was just checking the mail, one of the nice officers flags me down.   He is super concerned for my safety! He'd like to know about what kind of illegal activities have been happening around here and when. He assures me that the bike patrol (which he's part of) will start swinging by regularly, day and night, to make sure those junkies get the message. He is *so goddamn nice* to me.  And the whole time, I have three grams of fire tar in my pocket, which I'm tightly clutching because I'm terrified it will somehow leap out onto the ground.

I guess I will go first...  I started off in my senior year of high school, got my wisdom teeth out and they prescribed me some hydros. Well I didn't even take them till a couple weeks later, took two before school and I was amazed on how amazing I felt, I was so talkative and I was actually paying attention for once. Well that fun only lasted a couple days. Then a month or so goes by and I went to snag one of my dads cigarettes and I noticed a couple pill bottles... so of course I check it out... little did I know my dad who I am really close with was getting loads of hydros and OxyContins (before the tamper seal). So I snagged some every so often when I knew he had extra from previous months.   At some point he noticed but my dad didn't care and started giving me some. Then his medical condition was getting worse so he would spend time in rehab (physical rehab not drug rehab). Well he would do rehab for a couple weeks at the most and when he was released they would give him all the left over medications to take home! Meanwhile he was still getting his monthly supply from his doctor. So we had plenty of pills. Sadly my dad is now full time at a nursing home, but I love my dad and visit him everyday. Plus I have met some really good connects at the nursing home!  Edit: BTW I do not blame my dad at all for my addiction.

4558,"It started with chronic migraines and Fioricet/Fiorinal. Then, I started having joint and muscle pain, stomach issues, exhaustion, all kinds of stuff. After a LOT of testing, I got diagnosed with fibromyalgia. That led to some xrays, which led to further diagnoses of bulging disks, arthritis, and bone spurs in my cervical spine. All of that adds up to a lot of pain. I started out getting prescribed tramadol, when that didn't touch the pain, we tried Nucynta (I had heard on a fibro message board that it was good for fibro pain). Nucynta kind of helped, a little. Then we went to oxycodone, then to Oxycontin as a long acting with oxycodone as a short acting. At that point the short acting wasn't helping anymore, so through a few dosage adjustments and other meds I can't remember, we ended up at Oxymorphone. At this point, I'm disabled, in pain more often than not, and the pain meds just make life liveable. All of this took place over an eight year time span (It's hard to believe it's been so long.

4624,"On a recent visit home i was blindsided on the last day of my visit to find out my brother (who i have been extremely close to my entire life) has been shooting up fentanyl at Work and was going to rehab.  He has never been to any drugs before besides marijuana and never taken opiates. He has definitely battled bad depression and also alcoholism (he was prob a ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù alcoholic) this year.   According to him he has only been on fentanyl for 3 months and was only shooting up at work (he works 3 days a week) and the most he did was 500 micrograms in one shift. I did catch him with a fentanyl in his pocket about a month ago which he said he returned to hospital (he now admits he actually used it) and also he admitted to injecting over Xmas when he was off work (so these kinda go against him saying he only used at work). Also besides fentanyl he said he just took 1 morphine XR one time and no pills besides that.  Like i said some of this doesn‚Äôt add up but he really has no reason to lie about it now.   My question is do you think it is possible for this one 30 day stay in rehab to be enough to help him get sober? I have heard so many horror stories about multiple stays At rehabs not working. However, 3 months doesn‚Äôt seem that long, will that help? He definitely wants to get sober.  """"","Positive"

4629,"Well. Fentanyl isn‚Äôt usually a drug someone can just casually shoot up a few times at work bc it‚Äôs so strong that he would most likely die immediately, unless he had been using a lot of other opiates for a decent amount of time. Also, a lot of people work their way up to shooting. They‚Äôll start using weaker opiates first and they won‚Äôt be shooting them up until they‚Äôve built a tolerance to other routes of administration.   To answer your questions about rehab, It‚Äôs totally up to your brother. If he‚Äôs ready to quit then 30 days will be long enough. If he‚Äôs not ready to quit, 30 years in rehab won‚Äôt be enough.   But just to give you an example. I was addicted to opiates for almost 11 years when I went to rehab for this first time at the very end of October, 2017. My stay was for 23 days. As of right now I‚Äôm at 104 days since I last used. I still have a long way to go but 23 days did work on me (so far) bc I wanted to be done. On the other hand I know a ton of people that have been to rehab multiple times and are still using. So unfortunately there isn‚Äôt a clear answer as to what will happen once he is out of rehab.   I genuinely do hope the best for him and hope he is ready to be done and his stay will be long enough for him.  """"","Positive"

Usually I have shit grammar and will not make sense when on Ambien but I think because it was only half of pill, I was between sober and an Ambien Zombie.   First off, sorry it's not opi-related, I asked this elsewhere with 0 replies so far, but since this is the main sub i  browse morning and night, I will ask here if possible.    Hi all, had a few questions to anyone who has BOC online. Basically, just set up a checkings today with BOC and just set up an online account too. I know with Chase bank, there is a lot of fraud prevention steps to logging on online. For example, a new computer needs verification by email or text. Also, for example if I use my debit card to make a purchase over $XXX Amount, it will send an email over, etc, stuff like that.  The lady today helping me set up the account told me I need a smart phone to use BOC online but can use it at the computer so I was wondering how similar it was to Chase online banking. Is BOC linked to the email address like if its my first time logging on at a location, will I need to verify with code? Can I set up text alerts without a smart phone? (Like placing a number on the account for protection, like BOC will send a text with a code to me if any log in problems), or anything like that? Or is it simply, use your email and password at any desktop/location and you can log in to view your banking information?    Thank you anyone who took their time to read and/or respond. Have a good day!!!     =============================================================  =================== Random Opiate story that was promised.======================  ===================================================  (First time buying crap Heroin when studying abroad)   I use to study abroad in China (Guangdong Province) a few years back. I was sent there originally to teach English but the program I signed up for didn't provide me with the ESL classes/certificates when I got there so didn't end up teaching. I had an addiction (heroin, but loved blues and opanas) problem back in the US, and Overdosed twice in the 2 months prior to going so my parents/aunt put money together and signed me up for a semester to learn Chinese to give myself time to get back to normal. They thought the strict laws there would deter people from selling and especially me from using. But during the first semester, I somehow managed to get myself into a bunch of shit and addicted to H again. What fucking shit.  About a month into the semester, I was with my friend Tack who was a skinny Indonesian kid with a bunch of tattoos and a funny looking face, he told me he met some new friends who were going to the club and asked me to go. A club was popular place to go among the foreigners. It was around 7pm and we went first to meet up with his new friends he met. So we got to their apartment, and what do you know, 2 Frenchman. They were 2 brothers, Tom and Arthur. Their apartment was very very nice and expensive, even for regular foreigners it was pricey. I say this because 1 USD = 6.1 RMB the time I was there and the USD just went farther making it seem like you are richer, but this apartment was nice is all I am saying. Anyways, both of them spoke English well, and Tom actually went to Cambridge University in England. Tom was also studying at the same school me and Indo Tack studied at but he was also there working in Finance in one of the big companies there (hence the expensive aprtment). His brother Arthur was in town visiting because it was his birthday.   So we are pregaming at their place since they bought some Chinese beer (Tsingtao) and had a bottle of some liquor i never seen before. I'm not a drinker so i got buzzed pretty quickly. I pulled Tom aside and asked him how long he was there for and if he liked to party a lot. He told me he'll smoke weed every once in a while and even found people with weed in China. I was trying to slowly push his buttons to see if he fucked with opiates, but he told me back in England he did Coke a lot. Anyways, I was thinking to myself I would be fine with Coke. I've only done it a handful of times but I wanted to feel good that night and weed doesn't do it for me. So I asked him straight up if he had any contacts that could hook me up with something.   So he said yeah he has a connect there and gave me his guys number and told me to call him. I called him up and the guy has an accent made it more difficult to understand, I don't want to steriolize  but it was an African dude. It took a few tries but i asked him if he had Heroin after trying to beat around the bush, and he said yea he does and its $600RMB for a bag. I asked him if that was a gram or what? But he didn't understand me and I still to this day don't know how they measured out the bags. The 600 came out to around $95 or round up to $100 USD so I was expecting something good. He told me he'd be over there in 20-30 minutes.    So i didn't exactly tell Tom what I was buying, I think he thought it was weed, and for sure, Tom's brother and my friend Indo Tack had no clue and they were waiting to leave to go to the club but I was waiting on the dealer so i kept saying just wait a little longer wait a little longer. I'm not sure how long it took but he finally came thru and by this time it was maybe 8 or 9pm and was pitch black outside. We just met on the street because there was no where private we could go, and i asked him let me see it first and he said okay. I pull out the bag and opened it up and dipped my finger in for a taste, and although it was dark out, he's like man becareful here. And to this day I have no clue what I got, I don't know if it was heroin or what. I didn't know about Reddit then or thought I would be buying more, so I never thought to take a picture and save for later. But the supposely heroin was kind of small chunks of soft clay like texture kind of in the letter C. It wasn't powder by any means, but it had that vinegarish smell and in a way tasted a little bit like H or what i can remember it tasted when I was back in the US. I asked him 3 times, what is this shit, and he kept saying yes man it's heroin, it's heroin. Because of the taste and just wanting to feel something, i bought it anyways.    By now, Indo Tack, Tom and Arthur are outside and say cmon let's go to the club. So while we wait for a taxi, i tell them hold on and run to a public bathroom toilet quick to try and snort some of what i thought was heroin. Of course, there were no American style toilets in the bathroom, you have to squat to shit, So i had nothing to place my Dope on where i can crush it up and make lines etc. so i close the whole door on the bathroom and just use the sink and hope no one comes in. Anyways, so like i said before, the dope wasn't powder, it was this strange substance, I still don't know how to describe. Only if I saw it again I would be able to know. But I dump out a little bit and use my card to try and crush it up and cut out a line. The dope didn't really crush, like it was clay like and just got smooshed when i tried pushing it down. But the taste and the smell was just too similar to what I remember of H, so i kept trying at it. Eventually, shit breaks alittle bit but not into fine powder. It's kind of like bigger chunks but it's the best i could do with the time so I snorted it and went back out to catch the taxi with my friends.   5 or 10 minutes pass and there was definitely something in that shit i bought. The feeling came on strong, a little euphoric, but not that much, but I was feeling something. I don't know if it was a placebo effect, but I swore I felt a small head rush like when you do a line, and then in a good mood after that. Since it did the job, i never questioned it and did hit up the dude a few times after that. (He came with powder after that which more resembled H then that first time shit). So we went to the club and got mad drunk and i told Tom and Arthur what i got and they asked for a line lol. I told them exactly what i told you guys, it wasn't like normal dope and it has a strange texture and they didn't care. They snorted some and said they felt good too and we hopped clubs a few times and ended up going back at 7am.    Anyways, sorry for the long rant, this was just the first time i picked up in a foreign county. Later on, i met a different dealer with 100 times better shit like AMAZING shit, and other things that happened to me, spent 2 weeks at a detox hospital (I was only foreigner in there), and it was mad strange there!, also saw a regular doctor who prescribed medicine for withdrawals, getting hooked onto sleeping medicine and not remembering a lot of stuff (Zopiclone/Ambien drugs), got into a street fight while waiting for my dealer, and had to do some grimy shit to get some money there, which i can tell these stories/or answer questions if anyone is interested.. only because this was mad long and kind of shitpost/rant, so i don't know if anyone actually read this. If you did, thank you!   Thank you for reading if you got through all of it.   Have a great night! """"","Positive"

I believe that both alcohol and opiates are equally as destructive to a person, you are tempting fate by continuing to use opiates.  """"","Positive"

Millions of years ago, yeah, avoiding others/fearing those who looked different could mean the difference between life and death. Nowadays tho, like a lot of these ancient caveman things that're leftover in our brains, that serve no real agreed upon purpose, and typically cause a lot more harm than good.   This is just my guess for a lot of things that people do, that seemingly everyone has either experienced, and/or done themselves or witnessed being done... that imo are sorta just part of the human condition, and the best thing we can do is be as conscious about these mainly subconscious traits, keep on top of them, and if you notice yourself slipping back into the ignorance of the past actions, self correct.

4850,"My advice on subs based on personal experience. My usage of blues was similar to yours. Wait 24hous after last dose of oxy or at least 14 hours so you are in moderate withdrawals. First dose of sub I would start with about 4mg and if you don't feel enough relief I would take 0.5mg every 1.5-2 hours as needed. Day 2 id dose at same level as day 1 or w.e I felt I needed for relief. First 2 days I don't think it really matters how much sub you do. On day 3 I would try to cut the dose in half but at minimum take less than day 2 (example if I took 6mg on day 2 I would try to do 3mg on day 3 but if it wasn't enough id take slivers of 0.5mg as needed. Day 4 I would cut the previous day dose in half so if day 3 was 3mg then day 4 would be 1.5mg. I keep cutting dose in half until I get down to 0.25mg which is when I would try and start skipping day. Let's say it's like day 6 you take 0.25mg then skip day 7 then day 8 take 0.25mg (or less if possible) skip day 9 skip day 10, then dose again on day 11 (dose should be same or less than day 8). Then you should be able to jump off.   I use the following link to help with taper plan : https://www.drugs.com/forum/featured-drugs/suboxone-subutex-therapy-50887.html   Hope I was able to help.

During that year the law changes, you're now fine to drive on the dose I was on, so I reapply for my license with this in mind.

A year later, by now I've just started lying on my tests - I either stop for a few days before the tests or switch to taking Fent so I don't piss dirty. But the goalposts move again, I hadn't pissed dirty for something like 2 weeks shy of a year so the DVLA now ask me if I've got any drug use in the last **three years**. They now decided that I had to have a full year clean as well as minimal dirty tests for the other 2 years, so once again my license is refused and I'm banned from driving for a year.   Finally another year goes by, I reapply and after dragging their heals for 6 months (sent me to 2 different DVLA approved Drs for full tests as well as asking for both my GP and drug worker to test me) they reluctantly gave me my license back.

They have a smoother euphoria, opiates make me feel good about doing nothing, stimulants make me feel good about doing things. To me, Meth doesn't feel euphoric on its own, it only makes doing things much more fun. It increases the reward of things like playing video games or cleaning the house. Heroin you can just sit there in a chair and feel good but doing things also feels good. Heroin you can relax or do things. Meth will make you do something. Same with Dextroamphetamine.

Yeah they have to pay more in general for the dope, not to mention all the bitcoin related fees, shipping, etc. But seemingly everyone I've talked to or seen mentioning dark net markets, who've used them correctly, were often way happier using that than the street, unless they either had a really rare, great local connect who'd deliver, have consistent shit, not have fent, etc. ...either that, and/or they only use a connect or cold cop if the DNM order is taking too long, or maybe they don't have enough yet to pay all the fees, shipping, AND place the minimum order.

The tin man was a fool: From before the fall, it is that holy feeling we all search for; the orgasm in slow motion, the sunrise that brings light to the dark places and sends the shadows into retreat. Reminiscent of that moment before dawn, when everything was new. It is fragrant with memories of that last picnic, when you, your mother, and your father were together as one for the last time, when you needn‚Äôt ask, nor be told, you simply knew; you were loved. It is the word that has a name but that for the life of you, you cannot remember. It takes you back to when you did, and you almost recall, but then you forget you ever cared. It is a pensive bliss, a forlorn glee. It is the tides‚Äô gentle lapping at your toes, lazily kissing more and more of you until your every fiber is graced by its warmth and your entirety is submerged in a sea of sedation. It is a tranquilizing nostalgia, a paralyzing peace; a perfect calm and quiet rest, such that you dare not move, lest you disturb the stillness, the innocence. But you haven‚Äôt any cause to move, for everything is as it should be; as though the caretaker of your heart has flipped the breaker to every frayed and sparking nerve keeping you awake to the pain of this world, closed the blinds, and turned out the lights that you may sleep now for the first time in years. It is as though a divine hand has clasped hold of the soul you let slip from your grasp so it may be spared the harshness below. You may rest without worry, for you have no need of love. Neither to or to be. Without risk there is no reward and you will take the participation ribbon for no reward is worth the risk. The tin man was a fool. Isolated and immune, you are Only; this flower coated armor your best and only friend. Empty; you will outgrow it. What then? In the interim, sleep long and breath easy; you are loved, though you do not care to know it.   """"","Positive"

I use a cotton filtration on two pills and then a micron filter to get out all the gunk.

I do both these things so they hit with maximal intensity, if I could IV hydro I would but you can‚Äôt, not to mention all the APAP. And who cares why I put a needle in my arm? Of all the things to iv I think benadryl would be better than dope. I‚Äôve been doing this for a few weeks now, my veins look and feel fine and I‚Äôve never missed a shot and I always seem to register the first time. It‚Äôs a badass combo for someone with as low of a tolerance as I still have. Plus I think the whole thing is fun. Prepping the shot, micron filtering (yeah, I take proper precautions), tying off (I usually don‚Äôt need the tourniquet though), registering, and finally injecting. Using alcohol pads and new rigs and everything. It‚Äôs huge hassle just for benadryl for sure, but it hasn‚Äôt caused me any problems thus far and works beautifully for my purposes. I enjoy my little routine and everyone else can go fuck off if they don‚Äôt let like it. I just found the fastest and most efficient way to use benadryl for potentiation. I‚Äôm not hurting you, and I don‚Äôt  think IVing bdryl is gonna ruin my life like dope. This is just how I like to enjoy those two drugs in combination. Deal with it. I use .45 and .22 micron filters after a cotton filter. If I was injecting my hydro, even after a CWE, that would warrant this kind of reaction. But I take all the proper precautions and am having fun. I didn‚Äôt go buy all these rigs and equipment because I wanted to shoot benadryl, I bought cause I was using steroids and I said well why not order some insulin syringes too in case I ever get ahold of an opiate that I can inject. I haven‚Äôt yet, but I did find I could inject benadryl and it turned awesome.  So there‚Äôs the story. Suck it.  """"","Positive"

You feel so empowered by being able to keep it under control...until you don't have it under control. It's one sparking depression-causing event away from full on use. You think this or that serves as a functional gatekeeper. Stuff like your availability isn't there, or you only are an abuser of circumstances like having a surgery, or that cost will remain prohibitive. I thought so too until I got into the p0d trade a few years back before they were essentially banned. It was 100's of $ worth of Oxy in morphine and thebaine for $20. Endless availability. Then when those went away I found alternatives that I refuse to mention. Again $10 for at least $100+ in dope. Even without that gem there's always nearly pure dope online on the DNMs for like $60/g of fire tar or $120-200/g of the purest ecp you've ever seen in your life, all fent test strip-negative. Next thing you know you've got 3-4 solid friends who start copping off you even though you never asked to sell, and you justify it as \well at least they won't OD on fent I'm doing them a service.\"" Well great","Positive"
359,"Yep that's true for the most part. Whether fortunately or unfortunately, kratom could never even touch my tolerance by the time I found it, even the best online reddit-approved kratom. I'm ordering some kratom extracts this coming week but I know it's very unlikely I'll even get off. I was dumb enough to think that as long as my use wasn't costing me a lot (it was only like $6 a day back when my source of opioids was still available, and that's $6 to be 250mg methadone-tier nodding out) and as long as my DoC causes no physical damage (opioids), and as long as my DoC had very low OD risk, that there was no logical reason for not using. I didn't realize that post-dependency depression and the like is very real and extremely sucks. What's even worse is that the kindling effect is VERY real, even if you go months or even a year without use. Your tolerance permanently raises more quickly, there's permanently less euphoria after that first relapse, there's stronger WDs that can come back even with only a week of use, and then after that week of use your WDs can and will come back just from a 2 day going hard binge. It's just a shit wrap that's plain not worth it. I recommend getting on either ULDN ultra low dose naltrexone or possibly full on LDN low dose naltrexone, that functions like Vivitrol but you can stop using it any time. """"","Positive"

I was so into NA at one point and it gave me freedom from active addiction but as I slowly stopped doing what was working for me I fell into old habits and went back out. The only requirement for membership is the DESIRE to stop using, so when I end up taking my seat back in those rooms, god willing I make it back - I won‚Äôt feel ashamed or worse for giving recovery another shot.

I've purposely just IM'D or subconsciously injected when finding a vein was impossible at least 200+ times and I never had anything close to an abscess.  This was with Dilaudid, Oxymorphone, and Morphine pills 90% of the time which should be just as dangerous if not worse then H. But I've done it with black tar as well. Alwaya felt dumb when it became even a little sore and would start antibiotics right away if that happened. But daaaaamn. You arent the first person I've known or the last. Even personally that has gotten a severe abscess from missing  Was this from H? Pills? East Coast Powder? BTH? And how did you filter it. I'm assuming it was just the standard cotton filter and you missed? Geez thus scares me. Now that I'm terminal they put in a central venous catheter but I have to be VERY careful if I put anything in there that isn't given to me RX made to IV, As much as people don't want to stock up Micron Filtera for every shot (these days I do huge batches of 100s of Dilaudid or Morphine at a time into bacteriostatic water with 0.9% saline. Going through a .45um to a .22um into the vial)  I'm atleast somewhat proof that it will save you A LOT of pain and agony plus the hospital bill is waaaaaaay more expensive then buying 25-50 Micron filters, luer lock barrels, and bacteriostatic water with 0.9% saline off the internet.

735,"I totally understand this as 95% of my life I lived in southwest beach areas where you could absolutely not buy syringes without a insulin RX, shady pharmacy, or needle exchanges.  Even though I live in an area now that will at least sell syringes they don't sell anything else. This is where the internet is your friend because it is not illegal to ship these supplies to stubborn states that won't let you buy OTC. I can name a few very reputable and very reasonable places to get luer lock barrels, Micron filters, and I'd only suggest bacteriostatic water vial and 0.9% saline if you plan on buying or you get pills or H in bulk and want to just make an IV/IM ready vial for the whole month otherwise it isn't that necessary.  You can boil tap water if need be. Even Amazon will ship Micron filters and luer lock barrels anywhere in the US. Even though I use a medical supply company that has everything and is reliable. $15-$20 will get you 300 1cc Insulin Syringes in any garage and length needle you prefer. You can turn around and sell the needles for .50 cents - $1 each  if you need too and more then pay for all of them plus everything else. 10 luer lock barrels and 25 Micron filters is around $15 and will last a loooong time if you are filtering large amounts. And the vials plus bacteriostatic water with 0.9% saline for injection are less then $5 for the large vial and the 2x 30ml multi use vials I filter into for storage.  If you don't need the vials and just filtration good enough to even filter bacteria out that the human eye can't even see (even turns black tar heroin into a see through light yellow liquid without a potency drop) then you can get 300 needles and the Micron filters with luer lock barrels for under $30 shipped. If you even sell 30 out of 300 needles which people in the southwest beach cities never hitched about for $1 a pop... You've made all your money back with 270 clean needles and the Micron filters plus luer lock barrels at no cost to you at all. I know it's super hard being a Junky and spending your money on anything else... I've been there for years and years. But this is truly an easy to access cheap actually even profitable way to keep yourself healthy and avoid abscesses. I've been injecting HUGE amounts of opiates multiple times a day for almost 15 years straight with no abscesses, infections, etc. Now that I'm terminal I don't use H that month and mainly take my entire Dilaudid and IR Morphine RXs and make them into clean vials for the month... But I've done plenty of black tar in my days. I didn't always take this approach and it screwed me over and then I decided with my knowledge of chemistry, medicine, and harm reduction that it was the best way to prolong my life, health, and my veins. That's why I said if I had the extra money is literally send this stuff out for free to anyone who needed it. Also like I pointed out you can easily get a tiny hustle on with the same syringes alone to make back every penny spent... And even some extra to but H if you wanted to, That's all I was trying to say man. Just offering up some help to those I love and an idea they can run with to stay healthy, keep your veins healthy, avoid Hep C which I DO have had went through horrible and expensive treatment for, and possibly get them done free dope if they can hustle a little.

Without taking my Adderall when I need it the concoction of meds they have me taking makes me tired as hell.

Now that I have a permanent IV line in my chest going into my left ventricul of my heart a lot of my meds are slowly being switched to IV ampules anyways and they are slowly phasing out oral opiates for me. Meaning I won't need to keep making vials out of pills through the process I have been doing it for a long time.  I have a degree in chemistry and was moving on to med school before my life got put on hold and I went from having a very annoying chronic illness that was super painful to being told I only have 6-8yrs to live no matter what I do...

While I'm here im doing the best I can to help anyone I can at staying healthy as possible if they are going to use. I strongly believe in harm reduction as it's proven denying people access to clean syringes and proper education on how to use IV opiates, or any drugs for that matter doesn't stop it from happening anyways. It just spreads disease and causes unnecessary health issues like the OP's abscess that is incredibly painful, cost a lot of money to treat, and can actually he fatal.

Literally we were hanging out one day he showed me what happened after a missed shot when it was WAY late and he needed to go to the hospital immediately. Turned into MRSA and then after a 6 week fight we took his body back home to the east coast and buried him,  He was only 36... ... ...

I'm over 30 years old, and I made myself walk in the door.  Some of the characters at NA tonight reminded me of ghosts in my past. some of the personalities so hauntingly familiar...not of people I use with... but specifically of friends & family that are dead or gone.  . If I don't keep busy then It gets real bad. So when I'm awake i  try to do anything and everything. Busy all morning i came back, no one was at the place I'm staying..duck... I paced around..ive been trying to get into Witcher 3 but I havnt been able to make the jump. It would have been a great way to pass the time ...keep my mind occupied but I couldn't focus.  Instead..I rigged the game, texted some people about how great I was doing, while conversing back and forth with a dude I know can get meth for cheap but he's the sketchiest home I know. Him and his shady fucking lady. I couldn't meet up with him until later..and ignored all gut feelings or instincts  to not meet up with dude... I didn't even plan on a good outcome. No 'spun as fuck getting fucked up' -- outcome. I thought if I meet this guy  ill get robbed or probs.end.up in jail. But I'm gonna risk it anyways. I could hear people talking behind my back in the near future..  it wasn't like the.meeting was particularly spiritual or moving. But something about being in a room fill of addicts. Knowing at least some of.them legit want to get better, it's still with me. once I got out I never en ded up texting dude. Instead this bitch is drinking TEA and reading.a book.

No amount of ambien mixed with all kinds of cocktails of drugs used for sleep worked I was sure I was already dead and in what one might consider hell. My own personal hell.. i had already died and had to keep suffering the moments before my death for all eternity over and over again... of this i was certain. the illusions ones sleep deprived mind can come up with are so real you can barely tell reality from this lucid nightmare. grounding ones self is so fucking hard during a hardcore near death experience as this. but i was incapacitated lying on a concrete floor sweating shaking vomiting crying unable to really control many if any functions of my body while wanting death more than anything I had ever desired. at that point you could have offered me a bullet to the head or a billion dollars i would have chosen the bullet. I longed for the grim reaper to come kiss me with that sickle right across my throat. i remember mustering a grin from every ounce of my energy ay the thought of that sweet kiss of death. dehydrated broken depressed starving dry heaving coughing writhing while having serious tremors in pain begging to die on the floor unable to move. what a way to go i thought to myself. there's not much shit else you can do once you reach the peak of that mountain of opioid heaven and fall from the stars except hope you don't hit anything on the way down. I bet no amount of a psychedelic of any kind has shit on the illusion and para-schizo-esque lucid nightmare-ish places and things you go through coming off this shit. im surprised that didnt make me retarded permanantly disabled or fucking kill me or something.

943,"I quit IV Herion 8 days ago, I did cave and snort one bag because of horrible stomach pain thats from a virus I got about tuesday/wednesday. TBH I've had 3 stomach conditions for years and since about last june it just seems to have gotten worse. Doctors can't find anything even with MRI's and Catscans, the works. I've had two tell me they see this sometimes and they say with abdominal pain it's tricky. They know I'm in pain and not faking, but sometimes they just can't fix it ever. Both said it's possible I may just have to live with it forever. I'm only 28. While this bug has put me in so bad pain I've slept one night in a week and only a few hours and eat about half a cliff bar a day. Even when I haven't had this virus the pain is less but it never, ever, goes away. I'd give anything to have like knee pain or something but this constant burning knife in my stomach is hard to imagine living with forever. That's really about 80% of the reason I was using H and stealing even while on probation which I've violated. There's only so much I can take. Recently me and my coppin partner/partner in making money how we can just haven't been able to make half what we used to and the 9/10 dope that used to be around just dissapeared. I was shooting bundles and giving the feeling a 1/10. I just got tired of being dopesick 50% so I quit. I don't even care about the one bag today I sniffed. It was just to get a couple hours of relief. I don't plan on going back on H. I know this will sound weird but while my buddy is still struggling to get off the garbage dope, I started smoking crack which to everyones surprise helped me quick dope. I'm not really into stimulants and it's definitely not my drug of choice but theres so much chaos in my life right now even 5 minutes of a dopamine rush is bliss and I was attracted to the non physically addicting part. My fiance dumped me almost the same day I quit H. She never found out about my addiction. It was other issues that caused the split. I still love her and avoided contact until wednesday which was a mistake. She acted happy as a peach(she was faking which I will explain later). That crushed me. My mom is sick of my addiction even though I don't live with her and now wants nothing to do with me. Literally the only family member who still had my back after I went to prison for felony assault which I got for fighting back when my brother tried to murder me. My state has no self defense laws. Every day gets worse. This virus is 4 times worse than my dopesick was. I know its hard to believe because IV dopesick is bad but thats really how bad this virus is. Even though I should be in bed, mentally I can't sit in my room alone. So sick as fuck, I go around making money in non moral ways and buy crack while my friend gets dope. I think the only person who gives a shit about me is that addict friend. In 6 months, even when I just met him as a middle man, he has never beat me out of a dollar. We split everything 50/50 and we trust eachother completely. I've pawned everything but my computer. Last night I couldn't breathe in my room and slept downstairs. When i woke up 2 hours later, I went to take my meds. I've been prescribed klonopin for 10 years because I got a brain injury in a car accident and it just fucked my circuits. No non benzo helps at all. I should have had about 23 in my bottle and when I went to take it there was fucking 3. I had a problem in the summer and noticed a few were going missing here and there but never like this. I have to go to the hospital in the morning and hope they give me the 5/6 day supply I need until my refill. In the summer when whichever roommate stole a bit too much I was only 1 day short and the hospital was really cool and gave it to me based on my word and I was out in 20 minutes. I'm hoping since this is only the 2nd time they won't give me a problem but its also 5/6 worth of kpins instead of 1 and I really don't want to have to file a police report which is what my doctor requires if I go to her. I live with 4 people but it's a big house and I rarely see the 2 other renters. The other 2 are my landlady and her BF and I trust them and let them know the situation. One other renter is an ex addict and the other is just really weird. She thinks its the ex addict but hes been clean 8 years and I just hate to imagine him doing me dirty like that. Benzos are not a medicine to fucking take from someone considering the WD possibilities. To top it off, my ex fiance texted me about an hour ago she tried to kill herself yesterday. She wouldn't tell me much but it sounds like she tried to cut her wrists and her brother just happened to come into her room at the right time. Instead of being supportive her family screamed at her and told her she was fucking crazy. The breakup is so fresh and once I get my shit together she said there's a chance we could try again(this was wednesday). This is the second time I've been engaged. I tried to tell her to talk to me because I know that feeling of wanting to end it all very, very well and I would understand. She still wouldn't open up, said she wants to try again a different way and then cut me off the phone. I've already had a hard time keeping it together lately. As it is, next month, because I have a nice PO, hes only recommending and increase in probation level instead of jail time even though I've gotten two charges. As long as the judge agrees ill get another year on strict probation which if i carry on the way I am now I'll violate very fast. I have 8 years backup time plus whatever they'd give me for the new charges. I will die before I do that much time locked up. The time I did already broke me and made me a worse person. Jail hurts more than rehabilitates. I think just hearing the attempted suicide tonight was my breaking point. I broke down and cried and could barely breathe. If i got a call she does it again and does succeed then I honestly don't know if I could handle it. I want to marry this girl and she wants to die at 23 because she's having a bad week? I know this is not the usual type of post on here but I have really no one and this is a great community. I'm just looking for some support. """"","Positive"

Someone close to me was getting hit by health conditions from multiple angles but what seemed to do the final death blow to them were the hospital IV antibiotics. Essentially, all the good bacteria in their gut was eliminated and cdiff cultures took hold. Even prior to that final week they were experiencing stomach issues, unable to eat. Everyone thought they just didn't want to eat I suppose but for fuck sake this person would've loved to be able to eat. Fucking doctors or some boardroom was trying to push them out of the hospital on that final day. Maybe the Eastern European doctor thought the patient had it good and had a triage mentality but fuck them either way. &nbsp; Point I'm getting at is it seems that stomach issues are obviously not getting diagnosed in a timely manner. You're younger and healthier than the aforementioned person so you'll likely be able to go a helluva lot longer without an accurate diagnosis but maybe some yogurt and sour kraut will help.

1090,"To be honest this applies to pretty much anything and everything in life, but more so bad/negative choices that can have potentially bad consequences. I just ask that before you go forward with whatever decision or thought you have in your head, just stop for a moment and consciously and figuratively take a step back, reconsider and think about that action, DEEPLY. Think about what its going to do for you right now, in 5 minutes, 30 minutes, a few hours, how its going to impact tomorrow and the day after, how its going to impact this day next month, how its going to impact the other aspects of your life that you don't currently have on the forefront of your thought process... like your relationships, your finances, your mental health, your physical appearance, even your appetite! Your ability and desire to do things like building new relationships, set and to achieve goals, go to the gym, eat properly, provide for the ones you love, be there for the ones who need you, be able to react in emergency situations, this list can go on forever. But im just saying, just for a moment, consciously/figuratively/even literally take a step back, and think long, deep, and hard (ha-ha for whoever makes the joke) about where the decision will or where it could take you. If ANY of the conclusions that you come to of where the decision could potentially take you are places that you dont or would never want to be at, that right there should be enough information and all you need to recognize that the decision has more bad than good to it, and maybe you'll pass it up this time. There is always next time. And hopefully next time you do this same exact thing and come to the same exact conclusion. I can tell you one thing that is factual: You DO NOT want to live the lifestyle of an addict, whether it be opiates, stimulants, alcohol, etc., you do not want to live this life. Facts. You might think that it will never happen to you.. and hey, maybe it won't, BUT it probably will and youll wish you would have taken this advice. I wish I took this advice about a year ago, and im not even in a bad situation or in very deep, but one thing is for sure, and that is that i am in it. For the first time, i am actively in the life of an addict. Also one other random protip: NEVER SHOOT COKE. Me, i have always been a downers person, never enjoyed stimulants much at all, always made me feel shitty that night and the next day physically and just never felt much out of sniffing coke, no matter how good or how much i did. One night i was in a tinychat and i was told that IV coke is an ENTIRELY different drug than when it is snorted. I thought what the heck, i dont like stims theres no way i could get hooked on that, besides ive sold coke for years and never got hooked on it, i never even do it when i have free coke left over from ounces. After i shot coke, it became the most fiendish high i have ever chased my god. I am not aware of the dangers of how much is needed in a single shot to overdose or how much over a certain period of time, and i dont even enjoy the high that much, but since i no longer feel much a rush from shooting H, and the immediate rush and physical/auditory changes i feel from shooting a good dose of coke have made me practically mix a shot every 15-30 minutes until its gone at any point that i have coke. ive easily shot at least a quarter ounce of coke over the last week, and thats probably lowballing. STAY AWAY.  Tomorrow i am going to my first NA meeting. I am seeing a therapist on the 17th. And i will continue to fight this addiction until the day that i die. Please, just for a moment, really, seriously, reconsider. """"","Positive"

I usually don't sleep all that well when high so this has something to do with it, but I also think my receptors have changed due to long term use (I.e. stripped of dopamine).

There‚Äôs no good reason to tell someone they aren‚Äôt *really* clean when they‚Äôre doing so much better than they have in years. Who gives a shit if they need subs to do that?  Only the person themselves knows what is right for them and when (if ever) they should attempt to stop taking subs/done/kratom. It‚Äôs fine to talk them through this if they solicit your counsel, but otherwise, everyone should back off and just be happy when one of us finds a way to stop sticking needles in our arms or sniffing powder every day.  It goes beyond users / former users too though.

For me, I had an aunt that understood, and allowed me to detox in her basement, while her and my mom kept a watch on me. I didn't get sober, but I got clean off opiates, which really changed who I was. Or maybe just allowed me to let go of what was preventing me from becoming who I wanted to be. I still struggle with addiction, but not that hell that is opiates. Maybe on a fundamental level we're different, but that's the challenge you've placed in front of yourself, and you need to start a plan if you really want to change. For me, it took my family guarding me until the drugs had lost the grip that made it impossible to relinquish use on my own. Contemplate what might work for you, we're all different monsters.

1151,"**Symptom Management** In my state in the northeast I can buy Kratom at several headshops which I have found to be rather helpful. I have also successfully used psychedelics on several occasions and that has helped; as an aside Bill W a co-founder  of AA also suggested this. The success rate of Ibogaine is actually really high compared to other treatment methods and I have personally found success using them as they rewire your neurons via neurogenesis. Some people recommend using imodium in large doses as well and claim that it helps to manage the symptoms. **Social Management** Part of getting through this is also limiting yourself from actually  getting drugs (literally) and triggers. You need to delete all of the numbers for dealers and any way to contact them and intermediary friends. I have rebuilt broken cell phones that were ancient then either pulled phone numbers from them or old SIM cards. Don't under-estimate your own creativity. Try and distance yourself from people who use and block them; even if this is temporary. I have never gone to a meeting. I have quit many times for long periods. Most recently I was using ECP a couple times a week and managed my addiction to experience 0 WDs. That is not a suggestion but my point is I have successfully quit many times for prolonged periods of extremely heavy and light use. Most recently I quit several months ago. If you think meetings will help go to an AA or NA meeting. **Other Things** It gets better. For me typically around day 7 it starts to get better and you can get some sleep. Obviously temptation is always there but you will feel better. Excercise as much as possible and try and get out and about for walks or talks with friends. Every day sucks but they get better. edit: The comedian Russel Brand has been sober ~14 years. His new book *freedom from our addictions* just came out and I torrented the audiobook. I found it really really helpful. He was a former serious heroin user and takes a pretty interesting approach to the 12 step methodology which; while I don't totally subscribe to, was the closest I have ever come to trying it before. I read/listened to the book 2 days ago and am considering relistening.

1239,"Good morning people, will try to keep this short. I have legitimate chronic pain issues (terrible foot pain and chronic daily headaches). Both interfere with my life SIGNIFICANTLY! I've seen doctors for both and had surgery on my feet to decompress flattened nerves (diagnosis was tarsal tunnel syndrome). I've also explored every non narcotic option for both my head and feet. This is well documented in my medical records and doctors have even said I'm basically at the end of the road as far as conventional treatment goes. If I see a PM doctor how likely am I to get decent meds (not tramadol). I do have a history of opiate addiction (not something in my records because I don't tell my doctors). Just looking for relief, but to be completely honest with ya'll having a steady supply of some oxy would be nice (this is REALLY not my main motivation though).  Summary: I'm 28 years old. Significant chronic pain issues for 10 years (well documented and tried every non-narcotic option for both including surgery for feet). Considering the \opiate epidemic\"" in US","Positive"

Get a referral to a PM doctor and bring as much of the above as possible. Be ready to take a drug test. As long as you‚Äôre honest with the doctor and your condition is legitimate then you‚Äôll be fine. Don‚Äôt exaggerate the pain or tell them it‚Äôs always 10/10. Show them you‚Äôre doing your best to manage it and that you‚Äôre able to mask the pain quite a bit.

1687,"I‚Äôm on mobile so sorry for any formatting errors.  I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for 4 years and I have always known that he deals with severe pain on a daily basis. He was born with a deformity in his hip that causes the joint and socket to slowly disintegrate over time. He will eventually need a hip replacement. He‚Äôs also been in two serious motorcycle accidents in the last 10 years. The most recent one was about 3 years ago, and he almost died. He had a punctured lung and shattered his kneecap along with injuring several vertebrae. He was in the hospital for about a week and out of work for several months. He was given pain medication in the hospital but when he got out he was drug tested before the doctor would refill his prescription and he failed for weed. So the doctor gave him Motrin which he never took. I know this is true because I read the paperwork, even I was like wtf. As far as I know he has no legitimate prescriptions for any opiates.  He is the kind of guy that doesn‚Äôt like to show weakness and tries to be very masculine and macho in that sense. I know that he is in pain every day because I hear him whimpering in the morning when he thinks I‚Äôm asleep. He‚Äôs becoming more immobile and after work he just comes home and sits on the couch smoking weed until he goes to bed. He‚Äôs very stubborn and is terrified of the doctor so he just ‚Äútoughs it out‚Äù and refuses to talk to me about it (which is another big but unrelated problem in our relationship). So when he exhibits the behavior I‚Äôm about to describe and I ask him wtf is up he just says he‚Äôs ‚Äúfine.‚Äù  Now I personally don‚Äôt do opiates, and I actually think I‚Äôm allergic because they make me feel really sick and weird and itchy every time I take them. However, I‚Äôve seen people nodding off and have had friends that abuse them, so I feel like I know what it looks like. Over the past 3 or 4 months he‚Äôs been acting really fucking suspect and it seems like he‚Äôs fucked up for the following reasons: He comes home from work and immediately goes into the bathroom for like 45 minutes. When I ask him what he‚Äôs doing he‚Äôs says he‚Äôs taking a shit and that I need to leave him alone. Ok, that sounds plausible, but still weird to me since it‚Äôs like the same exact time frame like 4 days out of the week.   He just passes out on the couch, like head back mouth open passed out. It doesn‚Äôt seem like regular ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù and for someone that claims to only smoke weed (he never drinks) it‚Äôs seems really fucking odd to me. It gets to the point that I have to shake him and then he wakes up. Sometimes for a minute then goes right back to ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù or is just awake.  His mother is prescribed Vicodin and I know he ‚Äúoccasionally‚Äù takes one for his pain. He claims to only take it when it‚Äôs so bad that he can‚Äôt move. He frequently gets very defensive when questioned and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a fucking junkie.‚Äù  He‚Äôs a generally grumpy dude, but sometimes he just seems really high and way happier than usual. I‚Äôve been chalking that up to the fact that he‚Äôs a pothead but my gut is telling me something else is happening.  He‚Äôs also constantly broke despite working a full time job. It‚Äôs not a great job, it‚Äôs in a kitchen, but still. You should have some money and I don‚Äôt think weed and your car insurance costs your entire paycheck.  His general demeanor lately has been really uncharacteristic. Like extremely angry and just not giving a fuck about me or anything really. This past weekend was my birthday and he passed out on the couch at like 8pm with his head back and his mouth open. I kept checking his breathing and waking him up because it scared me. I told him all of this and how I think he was on something and he laughed and said he was ‚Äútired.‚Äù Wtf. I‚Äôm not a fucking idiot and I kind of think I already know this is what‚Äôs happening, but I would like some outside validation. Like I said, I don‚Äôt do opiates and idk if some people just sleep like that or if it‚Äôs indicative of being on something. I just want to say that I‚Äôm not judging anyone that does this, but I‚Äôm scared for him and I need to know if this is what I‚Äôm dealing with. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply.

So it‚Äôs not normal to sleep like that right?!

1726,"I'm an alcoholic with many friends who are/were addicts of opiods, your boyfriend's actions sound exactly like my experiences with functional opioid addicts. I've gone through rehab and am active in out-patient programs for alcoholics and addicts and the advice given here about not being confrontational is spot on.  I'm three years sober after 25 years drunk, like at minimum a fifth per day but usually a handle or more.  I was confronted many times by friends and family but it never actually got me to quit living in denial.  I was highly functional, two houses, a beach house, could retire at 38 had I wanted to, but I was killing myself and wanted to quit, but I didn't want to quit at the same time.  What worked for me was when I saw a way out, a way that would actually work, a plan and an honest recognition of what I was doing.  But, I was shown love, but not pessimistic and shameful love, not regret for my prior actions, instead I was shown love and optimism.  My wife and family were smiles and cheerful and helped me change my attitude to focus on what I WILL be, not what I have been.  Learn and be cognizant of the past, keep those memories as reminders but don't let them defeat and define me.  I could be that person I was before my addiction, with love and dreams and ambition and hope and joy, all the things I suppressed to avoid the other feelings such as anxiety, depression, sadness.  I went into rehab halfheartedly, thinking I'd get through withdrawals, they'd get me well enough to get out in a couple of months then I could socially drink again in a year or so.  Nope.  I relapsed twice for short spells.  Today I've had to learn to not actually want to be on a mind-altering substance, not just not do it, but not actually want it.  It took me a couple of years of sobriety before I felt this way, had to relearn what it meant to face issues head on, honestly, good or bad.  Attitude was HUGE, problems seem so small when a person doesn't let their mind conflate them.  My anxiety lessened so much and was no longer debilitating.  I now see a psychiatrist as well as attend a weekly meeting in an out-patient addiction recovery program.  I go to AA but only once per week and it's not really my thing. So, if your boyfriend is abusing opiates and you want to stay with him but want to help him get off of them then I would suggest being open, honest, but kind regarding his use.  Anything else will likely be met with him avoiding or trying to shut down the conversation.  If he's addicted to the drug then it's his #1 concern, or likely anyway, and that's in no way your fault, it's what addiction does to an addicts brain and priorities in life.  I love my wife and kids more than myself, but not enough to get me to stop drinking, I had to make that decision based on my want to stop killing myself, ruining my family, losing those I love so much.  But honesty and love go much further than accusations and resentment, that never works.  Good luck.  Oh, and if it turns out he is addicted then you might want to find a local nar-anon meeting and attend, you don't have to speak but my wife has told me the al-anon she goes to occasionally has really helped her to understand her feelings were justified, something I was rejecting for years.

However, it doesn't take 45 minutes to do a benzo whether popping, or some snort. And the other thing you said his money is always gone so that's an indication since an opiate addiction will drain your funds quickly. I remember working a full time job and had to pay rent, car insurance, internet, etc, but someone tried calculating my income with all the expenses and it'd still come out to like having +$300 weekly, but i'd have nothing at all and they'd ask where my money was going. How is your BF's sex drive though? One thing for sure is taking enough of it will kill his mood. At least for me, doing enough heroin does that to me. However, if i do a small amount, it actually helps me last longer sometimes (not always). If he has no drive at all and can't get hard, prob def abusing opiates. However, all of this is just an assumption, so without really knowing him or seeing him, it could all be a coincidence.

1795,"no problem, it is quite a difficult thing to open up about-- also trackmarks might never appear, i was addicted to heroin for 3 years but never touched a needle. You can smoke/snort it to the same results, especially if ur goal is pain reduction.  i remember when my back was hurting bad i got pretty badly depressed, even with dope i often lay around all day sulking-- there really is nothing worse than being in constant pain; eventually u get fed up and numb it. it does sound to me hes gotten very fed up with the pain. hes very lucky to have someone who cares enough to go out of there way to find out how hes doing, even if hes shutting you out. I totally agree you dont deserve to be lied to, but he will have his reasons for it-- perhaps he thinks youll judge him for it and doesnt want to lose you. opiates are hardly the most socially acceptable drug, it took me years before telling my ex (who was oblivious whether i was nodding or withdrawing) some tell tale signs of opiate use for you; --pinned pupils --nodding/drifiting in and out of sleep --difficulty reaching orgasm (he may last longer in bed than he used to or his sex drive may have reduced). this should be a tell-tale sign for you but he has to want to tell you, even with the best intentions if you keep prying for the truth to come out he might shell up and become defensive.  maybe dont look at it as lieing to deceive, but lieing to protect either you or the relationship. if it makes u feel better, its very rare people overdose via snorting/smoking or popping pills. that would only be something to worry about if finances forced him to pick up the needle to cut costs (this is the only advantage to shooting) best of luck to both you and your boyfriend-- i think as long as your there for one another, an unspoken understanding of the situation should suffice """"","Positive"

I totally fucked that off, didn't even see Bud until way later than initially planned. One of the things I had to take care of before going to that trap was with my homegirl, Flail-Bot 3000. She flailed and fuckin flailed and I tried so hard to work with her and ended up leaving her stranded in a rock quarry and way late to the dude who was supposedly dying. Could've lived could've died, I don't know.  So last night Bud calls me. It was a discouraging day for the guy. If he didn't have concrete, verifiable progress to his moving out of the house by morning he was getting thrown out then and there. With for the most part just a cello to work with, and him and I being in the trade of hard drugs not string instruments, we weren't getting our hopes up. No cello sale then no reliable living, no necessary resources, no being a father to a son, no shelter until jail via racial profiling by the police, etc. Since he considered it his last night at the house and he was just alone in it, he wanted me to come over and spend it with him. I get there, we chainsmoke cigarettes while we have real talk, share stories and try to sell other smaller items for at least a little something.

That and just from browsing DNM, it seems like oxy is almost more fucking readily available in Europe than it is in USA in 2018 which is insane to think considering where we were like 10 years ago or even less.  But yea he's not lying, they have OG 80s in Europe and are still producing them today and seem to be fairly common. I know that for sure.  When I was in Canada a few years ago CDN 80s were readily available which were exactly like OG (OC) 80s but they said CDN 80 on them instead of OC 80. IIRC they looked exactly the same, and were the same in pretty much every way. Not sure if Canada still produces those though, unlikely EU which I know for a fact does. Pretty crazy to think. Also in Europe, from what I've heard, there is basically no in between from codeine to oxy. In USA the ladder for prescribing is usually codeine (like T3s) then vicodin then oxy (percocet or whatever). As far as I know they don't prescribe hydrocodone at ALL in Europe, not even sure if it exists there in legal form. So you see way more codeine (which is also OTC in EU in most places as far as I know in some capacity) and you see way more oxy.  Take this with a grain of salt as I do not personally live in EU, just from what I've seen and heard from friends who live there etc. Sorry for the long post, time for me to go to fucking sleep lol.

I have been using kratom pretty much daily for about a year and a half, and that has helped keep my cravings at bay for the most part. today I decided I would try and chip knowing that I have an emergency stash of subs and a good amount of kratom to help keep some degree of control.  anyhow, I very carefully took a dose earlier this evening (with the friend who helped me scored from a reliable plug) spacing out each tiny bump over 15-30 minutes increments. all told I had about 4 small bumps before I reached what I guess you could call a high, but it was mostly drowsiness and me staving off my paranoia about taking too much. I also had a dose of kratom this morning and I‚Äôm sure that also interfered with the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù to a large degree.  my question is, if I was going to have any sort of adverse reaction would it be apparent by now? I feel fine albeit still drowsy, but I‚Äôm scared that if I lie down and go to sleep some reactive effects might creep up. I should note that I‚Äôve never OD‚Äôd before and want to take every precaution to avoid it (duh) even if it means not fully getting for and waiting till a day where I don‚Äôt have anything else in my system. also I‚Äôm transitioning medically right now (HRT) and on a dose of 2mg Estradiol and 100mg of Spiro, but I don‚Äôt know of any negative interactions. am I good to go to bed tonight lol?

If he wants to pick dope over you, let him. He‚Äôs always going to pick Black over you.  Unfortunately, a lot of addicts are also codependents. When I got clean the first time in Maui, I found a group called Codependents Anonymous aka CoDa. I‚Äôm not really into NA or AA at all, but CoDa is probably one of the coolest/satisfying meetings I‚Äôve ever been to. It really cuts out all the AA bullshit, and gets straight to the root of our issues as addicts that have been ingrained in us since childhood, and explains why/how we are in life with relationships, and everything in between. Idk why I‚Äôm getting hella into details but I feel like this information might help you out some day in your life. They don‚Äôt preach about being clean or anything like that in CoDa, it‚Äôs literally just about codependency in general. You should check one of their meetings out one day, doesn‚Äôt have to be anytime soon if you don‚Äôt want to. It‚Äôs an awesome place to go when you‚Äôre in a situation like yourself.  Anyways, idk how long you‚Äôve been with dude, or what he means to you or anything. So a lot of this is easier said than done, I‚Äôve been there too. I just don‚Äôt want you to become so dependent with someone like your boyfriend because eventually, you‚Äôll have nothing(sounds like you‚Äôre close) you will then justify why you can‚Äôt leave him, because you have nowhere to go, no friends/family, no money, no nothing because you‚Äôve exhausted everything to win his love. It‚Äôs literally a high. Your brain produces dopamine from codependency and it‚Äôs an addiction.  I‚Äôm not trying to lecture you or anything, I feel like I sounded like I was, but I‚Äôm just trying to help out someone who‚Äôs asking for advice cause I‚Äôve been there. You‚Äôre a big girl, you can leave. There‚Äôs bigger and better things in life, than some guy that would pick a dope sack over you. Fuck that guy, who lets their SO withdrawal and beg for dope?

I've learned this from being single for years now (by choice and I wouldn't recommend it for this long, been like 6 years) is that people that stay in bad relationships or keep hoping in and out of relationships don't know how to be single, like they don't enjoy their own company.

A bunch of chicks are upstairs getting costumes on for some Halloween party. They invite me and offer me a costume, I refuse. I leave the house and drive for a while, park on the street in some faceless city and start walking.. I see a blonde haired, skinny dude walk out of a building. He's bobbing his head as if he's listening to music. I follow him. He reaches into his pocket for his phone and out drops a colorful mix of baggies onto the ground. He keeps walking. I pick up the bags and catch up to him, tap on his shoulder. He mutters something without looking at me and continues to dance down the street. I put the bags in my pocket to investigate later. I return to the building he came from and open the door. It's an elevator. The buttons go in order of 1, 4, 5, 7. I press 1. The doors close slowly but then the elevator starts to rush downward, then sideways, then upward, then downward again.. Finally the door opens. I scramble out into a dark hall of elevators to be met by ghoulish creature. It looks like a thousand-eyed woman-centaur on a grasshopper's body. The walls are a dark, dried-blood red. The creature has a clipboard. She asks if I'm lost. I tell her I just want to go back home. She says I need to go to the first floor. I tell her that's the button I pushed.

3036,"Withdrawals are crazy. Any suggestions for withdrawal are helpful to me. I'm on methadone and have tried to get off of it but, due to several underlying medical conditions, it's a lot harder for me than most.  Some helpful things i learned: - I orginally thought Imodium AD was just for diarrhea but recently i found out that it has opiates (loperamide) in it. If i remember correctly, it doesn't pass the blood-brain barrier and is therefore non-addicting and allowed over the counter, but it's suppossed to help all wd symptoms. I never took it cause i didn't have diarrhea.. If i only knew!  Edit: might actually be addictive if used long-term. Do research on this first cause I'm truly not sure  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loperamide - Hot baths. Will help aches, pains and RLS. at times this was the only thing that helped. Spend the day in the tub if you have to.  - Kratom. Legal opiates that you can use to wean yourself with. I liked mixing with applesauce - there's a dosing/tapering schedule that uses half-life of the opiate to make the taper less painful and more successful. I'll edit it in if I can - look up 'the thomas recipe for opiate withdrawal'. It's pretty famous, if you haven't heard of it yet, check it out. What the hell I'll post it below. It's somewhat helpful > Thomas Recipe Taper your opiate dose as much as you can before hand, and if possible take some time off from work or any other obligations you might have. What you need: Valium or any other type of benzodiazepine like Ativan, Klonopin, Xanax etc. Immodiun. L-Tyrosine. Mineral supplement that contains at least 100% RDA of Zinc, Phosphorus, Copper, Magnesium and Potassium. You may not find a supplement that contains all of these together. If not, then buy separately. Vitamin B6. Access to hot showers or baths. Putting it all into action: ‚ÄúStart the vitamin/mineral supplement right away (or the first day you can keep it down), preferably with food. Potassium early in the detox is important to help relieve RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome). Bananas are a good source of potassium if you can‚Äôt find a supplement for it. Begin your detox with regular doses of Valium (or alternate benzo). Start with a dose high enough to produce sleep. Before you use any benzo, make sure you‚Äôre aware of how often it can be safely taken. Different benzos have different dosing schedules. Taper your Valium dosage down after each day. The goal is to get through day 4, after which the worst WD symptoms will subside. You shouldn‚Äôt need the Valium after day 4 or 5. During detox, hit the hot bath or Jacuzzi as often as you need to for muscle aches. Don‚Äôt underestimate the effectiveness of hot soaks. Spend the entire time, if necessary, in a hot bath. This simple method will alleviate what is for many the worst opiate WD symptom. Use the Imodium aggressively to stop the runs. Take as much as you need, as often as you need it. Don‚Äôt take it, however, if you don‚Äôt need it. At the end of the fourth day, you should be waking up from the Valium and experiencing the beginnings of the opiate WD malaise. Upon rising (empty stomach), take the L-Tyrosine. Try 2000 mgs, and scale up or down, depending on how you feel. You can take up to 4,000 mgs. Take the L-Tyrosine with B6 to help absorption. Wait about one hour before eating breakfast. The L-Tyrosine will give you a surge of physical and mental energy that will help counteract the malaise. You may continue to take it each morning for as long as it helps. If you find it gives you the ‚Äúcoffee jitters,‚Äù consider lowering the dosage or discontinuing it altogether. Occasionally, L-Tyrosine can cause the runs. Unlike the runs from opiate WD, however, this effect of L-Tyrosine is mild and normally does not return after the first hour. Lowering the dosage may help. Continue to take the vitamin/mineral supplement with breakfast. As soon as you can force yourself to, get some mild exercise such as walking, cycling, swimming, etc. This will be hard at first, but will make you feel considerably better. >  """"","Positive"

3096,"That's what I don't like about mixing benzos with Opiates, they kill the motivation and energy to get work done and have fun. Stims make the high more energetic and make stuff like movies and video games more fun. If I want a nod I think a straight Opiate is perfect. Benzos ruin most drugs for me because of its inhibitory actions but then again I normally lack motivation and have anhedonia (Pleasure deafness) ever since I was a little kid I always found it a battle just to get out of bed and motivate myself to shower or brush my teeth. Amphetamines and Heroin is just a treat every now and then. Most days I use Modafinil to help with my excessive fatigue. It seems that people that prefer benzos are overstimulated and people that prefer Stimulants are understimulated. Do you feel overstimulated all the time? like wired out? I always keep benzos around though when I use stims if I get too stimulated or need to sleep. Great for bad trips too. Most of the time I mix Heroin with LSD to prevent bad trips without dulling the trip so I won't need the benzos. Not bashing benzos, just not my thing for a recreational drug, its more of a medicine for last resort for me, and it works damn good in that instance. Had a friend freak out on 200ug LSD and 1mg Clonzepam fixed him up good. If you're into psychedelics try mixing some Opiates with them, really fun.

3264,"> Problem is that's easier said than done Truer words have never been spoken. I have been an alcoholic for 7 years. By alcoholic I mean if I don't drink I'm shaking and on the verge of having a seizure. The first time I stopped drinking cold turkey for a few months I picked up a pill habit.  It started as getting a few once a month which evolved into every two weeks when my guy got his script. That slowly evolved into me being able to get pills anytime I want. All the while I was ever conscious as to what was actually taking place here, I was trading one addiction for another although now I'm working towards being a junky instead of a highly functioning alcoholic.  My point being is I knew what the possible outcome was of my situation. Not only did I know but I didn't give two fucks less either as I was on the downslope. I never romanticized alcohol like I did with pills and I was about as hardcore of an alco as they come. When I was starting to get low on funds I never plotted from sun up to sun down on a way to get more liquor I just accepted my fate as what it was. Speaking from both sides of the fence, opiates wont kill you during withdrawal, alcohol will. I went through alcohol withdrawal yet my mind wont let me go without pills. With alcohol I seen my downward spiral and I was aware and took action against it. With opiates I am also aware of my downward spiral yet I could give two fucks less and in a way am ever so welcoming of the fact I'm gonna sniff 4 30's tonight, tomorrow and however long I manage to keep scrapping up money. Moral of the story is you think you are in control but you are not. My prior addiction could kill me if I didn't have my fix, this one wont. I never even thought about spending my electric bill or cable bill money on liquor and beer. Ask me that now? I will tell you how I can get an extension and hustle up a few bucks to pay it off eventually as long as I get my opiates I'm good, and the worst part is I'm perfectly ok with it.   """"","Positive"

I was kinda having a debate with my friend, I was saying that overdoses happen because the concentration of the substance isn't being legally regulated, so you never know how much is too much. One dose now could be ok, while the exact same dose from a different batch would kill you tomorrow. He was saying that people love the high too much and they lose control and inject more than they should. Keep in mind that none of us has any experience with hard drugs.  This was a great answer, everything is clear now. One more question...if I'm not getting too personal. If I am, sorry, you don't have to answer. Do you use heroin recreationally or as a medication/treatment?  """"","Positive"

3484,"So, If using medical grade drugs where this much per unit equals this much, you could use it safely... the problem with street drugs is unknown purity/unknown cut.... so x amount of heroin at 15% purity might get you right. x amount of heroin at 30% purity could make you nod super hard/ fall out a bit. x amount of heroin at 15% purity cut with fent or a fent analogue will kill you. It's basically a roll of the dice when you buy unregulated chemicals and inject them into your veins. """"","Positive"
3485,"Overdosing happens just how it sounds...Over dosing. Most people use the same dose over and over to get well, after a certain point there really is not point chasing a high by using more dope because that just means you will end up sick faster. Some time ago overdoses were just that, overdoses. Now that fent and all its analogues have come into play people are doing the same amount they always do and are dropping like flies from hot spots of fent in their gear. This isn't just limited to IV either, I know plenty of people who are dead who only sniffed. """"","Positive"
3489,"Heroin, specifically, is not pharmaceutically regulated so it‚Äôs concentration is different every single time they make a new batch. One day, .1g is a good dose for someone, the next day, .1g could be too much and they could overdose. Does that make sense to you?  """"","Positive"
3490,"Okay there are a couple things to mention. A huge number for overdoses are being cause by fentanyl. People are selling fake pills or fake heroin made with this substance. It is very potent and if it is not mixed accurately it creates hot spots where on pill or on flake of powder has much more in it. So they get a dose and didn't expect so much. Black out and die. You mention concentrations OP and that is another big problem. Since heroin is illegal there is no oversight in it's production. Every single batch is different in one way or another. Potency of some heroin may be as low as 4%, to where high quality can be 80%+. So a .3 shot of one is good where the other that may kill you. Another big reason is rehab. People quit, get totally clean and then relapse. They haven't done it in so long they don't have the same tolerance and do a similar amount to what they were doing when they stopped. Lost a friend to that. ( Edit to clarify dosage: A new user or one with no tolerance may get a good effect from .05g if it is potent enough. A habitual user may be using .5g in a shot and doing that multiple times in a day. Tolerance is a weird thing thing and it takes huge amounts of heroin or other opiod to maintain someone in active addiction) Standardized doses would save so many lives. Overdoses are going to increase in the US as they try to clamp further on opiods. The harder legit pain medication becomes the more people will have to rely on illicit supply and there will be more and more fentanyl fakes. It really sucks. """"","Positive"

3573," Considering we live in a society that is overworked, broken, hurt, kids abused and bullied with PTSD, no wonder why people use Opiates. It's an alternative to blowing their brains out. Remember suicidal people don't want to end their life, they want to end their pain and that's precisely what Opiates do. People with lots of emotional pain lack endorphins and Dopamine. They rather give you a bunch of anti-depressants that don't work. Some countries in Europe are studying things like Subutex and Methadone for depression and anxiety, short term use. All anti-depressants should be short term used or as-needed. Even SNRIs will cause severe withdrawal after only 2 weeks of using everyday. Brain zaps, seizures and all that. I find that Opiates work much better for anxiety than Benzos do. Benzos just make me tired and anhedonic.  And you're right about the Tylenol, they sell something that easily causes Liver damage yet they want to start trying to control Imodium. Maybe if they legalized Opiates and had them easy to get people wouldn't have to turn to street drugs. If Heroin were as cheap as booze addicts wouldn't have to sell all their stuff to fund their habit because the prices would be reasonable. We are grown men, adults. We should choose what we put into our bodies, not them. If they would offer education and safe use and sold weaker Opiates in stores like booze than a lot of Alcoholism and street drug addiction would stop.

3629,"Hey guys, today I went to the doctor and she told me that since tramadol I had gotten before wasn't working we're going to need to go into the controlled substances categories then prescribed me vicoprofen 7.5mg/200mg ibubrofen. to help with horrible pain from a pinched nerve (on scale of 1-10 it is a 6) and it isn't working(confused since it is a hard narcotic). I took 1 last night nothing. I took 2 yesterday and it didn't do anything for my pain, maybe 5% percent better. Today I took a whopping 4 of them and the pain is DECENTLY better (maybe 20-30% better tops) as in I can KIND OF focus on schoolwork/life. I'm kind of worried because what out there besides this can help me?! My dad once told me that he had taken codeine at something like 200-400mg and it did nothing to him and his doctor that dosage could have killed a horse!? I'm confused is something wrong with me? All I feel right now is drowsy/relaxed but not much in terms of pain relief. What medications stronger than vicoprofen are there to help me, also I should mention I don't want to be high or extremely tired all the time as I have alot of schoolwork at university and I code on computers which requires alot of mental energy/thinking/logical thinking which is hard enough as is even with my ADHD medication.

It's brain chemistry and we really dont understand it... The only thing i know is everyone has a vice, everyone gets off on something and it makes them feel good and thats it. People that are addicted to fatty foods or soda or driving fast or anger whatever just have to spend less money and probably get the same rush. long story short? the shit's complicated as fuck and it's WAYYYYY above my pay grade.

Not ideal, but if it is all I have and I want to make sure what I have works... well... Also - in case of emergency, if it is all you have, what about Suboxone or even Subutex in a shot or under the tongue... As a shot, even 2mg of Suboxone has 0.5mg of Naloxone... And 2mg of Bupe isn't gonna OD anyone. Even if the Naloxone didn't hit, the Bupe would replace the other opiates on the receptors throwing the person meanwhile, into Precipitated Withdrawal - and that would be good I think since PW means that at that time, there are few if any, opiates on the receptors. And even once the Bupe does attach, 2mg would be a low dose. And even in a non-tolerant person, it is notoriously difficult to OD off Bupe - it causes MUCH less respiratory depression than other opiates (and has a better safety profile in general) and the respiratory depression is what you're trying to reverse in an OD.

You happily wake up and go kill it at work. You can't believe people say this shits so bad because your doing great and your happy again. Shit was better then you even expected. Your cured! WRONG. It's not real. Your mind is clouded by the amazingness of the drug and you don't notice it until it's too late. If it started off horrible it wouldn't have the chance to fool you into getting addicted. It gives you a false sense of hope and happiness.  If you think you have nothing now... if you think you're depressed now.. it's nothing with a heroin addiction added to it. Once you are addicted you are an addict FOR LIFE.

In a text to a friend, she stated that she was shooting dope and smoking base. What would this kind of OD feel like? Was she in pain? Did she know what was going on? Did she feel cold? The 'friends' called 911 (we think), then took off and left her there. Nobody attempted CPR. The EMTs attempted narcan and used the AED but she had no heart rhythm. When her 'friend' was there, they saw she was breathing a little. I am wondering if CPR had been performed at the scene if she might have lived.  I guess I am just looking for answers. I love my sister so much and it hurts me that anyone would leave her like this, or that she might have been frightened or cold. She was still a human being and deserved to be treated as such.

Any way to address your concerns, she did not feel a thing except for quite possibly a really nice sensation before she died. A lot of /r/opiates people told me that when I made my same post here so many years ago and it helped a lot to know there was no pain and whatnot. Here's a few things I learned from my brother's death:  1. It's painful, it will ALWAYS hurt. The 2nd worst pain to losing a child is losing a SIBLING. Now despite how painful it is eventually, each day carries on while it will ALWAYS hurt you will develop (hopefully healthy) coping mechanisms to handle the pain. 2. Should've, Could've, Would've, and 'What IFs\ only make it harder for you to get past the initial grieving process. 3. Grief is not a straightforward pattern of stages. You can go from sad to bargaining to denial right back to sad and then acceptance and then anger all over again. 4. Healing takes time. Pamper yourself","Positive"

Amitriptyline, gabapentin, imitrex are three examples that are all in completely different classes of medicines (all of which have alternates within that class), lifestyle changes they can suggest, alternate medicine stuff like seeing a chiropractor or trying acupuncture, etc.. even messing with the dose of whatever you have already tried sometimes makes a huge difference (NSAIDs at prescribed doses can work well).  Just go in, be honest about how the pain effects your life, what you‚Äôve tried and what the results were, and have a very open mind. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people get PISSED that their doctor suggest an antidepressant for pain, thinking that means the doctor thinks it‚Äôs ‚Äúall in their head‚Äù or not real or whatever, when antidepressants actually are used off label for pain a LOT and can work really well. Everyone is built differently so be willing to try whatever they recommend (within reason obviously), and just be very honest about everything. There‚Äôs also nothing wrong with asking questions. Just obviously don‚Äôt show up and say ‚ÄúXYZ didn‚Äôt work, so now I need 30mg of oxy IR, three times a day‚Äù or something. Avoid asking for scheduled substances by name. Also the fact that you are on Ativan makes it likely that you‚Äôll not be given another controlled substance in addition to that, and probably not gabapentin, lyrics, etc either  I know it‚Äôs scary because you just want to be able to function!

Absolutely. And you know how I feel about everything, I see this as a form of harm reduction. I just wanted to put it out there that even with perfect sterile form this can still happen from IV ROA. We even can have this happen in the ER/ICU. I have seen it actually happen around a PICC line in the upper arm (arm pit side of the bicep) nothing is truly sterile, we try so hard in the ambulance and in the hospital to be clean and sterile but we have about a .9- 1.6% chance of having a MRSA infection per patient in the hospital. Those are considered acceptable risks, that is with everything being perfectly sterile. If anyone here uses via IV, I hope people understand, you have a non-zero chance of aquiring an infection like this. It's unfortunate, but the fact is over time, no matter how good you are you will eventually get an abscess or infection simply due to skin flora like you mentioned.I'm not trying to come off as preachy, I just want to let everyone know and have everyone be aware of the fact that this can happen to you no matter how good you are no matter how sterile, wether you miss a shot or not.

We take donations at the fire department for clean needles for our exchange which happens every other Friday if you're willing to donate. My state is one where having a syringe can lead to a charge of unlawful possession of paraphernalia :(( it's disgusting and gross but when they're stamped with our logo the police seem to look the other way according to the people I've met at the exchange. Ours is a pilot program initiated by myself and our medical director (big fancy doctor at the ER in charge of all emergency medicine and trauma surgery). We've expanded to three of our 7 fire departments doing this schedule and from what I understand and what I hear were really helping and making a difference! We're working on narcan & other stuff but we technically don't have a budget, our next quarterly meeting I'm doing a presentation on this exact subject and I'm going to talk to the OP about using this photo in it. We will hopefully be able to convince the city council to fund this and other outreach and public health and prevention issues to the tune of $250k a year. Ideally I'd like to see us fund it at 750k/year but that's a big ask for a department with a 7.5 million budget that includes payroll. So at the moment we are completely volunteer and completely donation funded. We've reached out to Suboxone doctors, treatment center, family physicians, put donation boxes up at hospitals and some pharmacy's, reached out to a pharmacy that donated about 5'000 100 count boxes with alcohol wipes, sterile water, wheel fillers and tourniquets. He really helped us get it off the ground (locally owned pharmacy who isn't allowed to sell syringes without a valid script for them or insulin). We're doing well and have enough to last is two months at this point but we can always take more. Getting funding is very challenging.

537,"Smoking in my opinion is the better route of administration. You can feel the effects quicker and titrate the dose accordingly. If it is normal heroin, it works much better to add caffeine pills to it. About half heroin half caffeine pills. It allows it to burn at a lower temp so less is wasted. Mix it half and half and place the powder on a piece of aluminum foil. Use some kind of straw and heat the foil from underneath. Heat it slowly so it doesn't burn as much. The trick to catching the smoke is to keep the lighter directly below the straw and only move the foil. Do not try to chase the smoke. Just move the foil to where you want it to burn. Hold the foil at a slight angle so when it melts it runs a little and don't keep it at the same spot.Nodding is much similar to what you described. However when you get higher you may just fall totally asleep. The effects between opiates are very similar and dose dependant. It is just much easier to get a higher dose of heroin.As far as starting dose take about half a tenth, mix it with caffeine and just smoke it. After taking a few hits wait 5 or so minutes to gauge the effects. You can decide then if you want more or not.Edit: noticed you are not in the US. If you get #3 which is made for smoking you do not have to add the caffeine. If it is made for shooting then it is a good idea to. Even if it is made for shooting it smokes fine with the caffeine. Just ask if you can bang it without changing it. If yes then you know it's #4 and you should add caffeine to smoke it.Also the difference between smoking and snorting is delayed onset. Smoking hits you much quicker. There is some belief that smoking may be more addictive due to the oral fixation quality, but it also may be much safer as it is much easier to titrate dosage.Good luck. Be safe. """"","Positive"

You won‚Äôt be able to weigh this out, but it‚Äôs about the size of the tip of a match head (crushed up). Then take tiny bumps (about that size, a bit bigger if you feel nothing from the first bump) every 10 minutes til you get to where you wanna be.Number 3 for smoking, number 4 for snorting. You can still snort 3, you just gotta cook it with a bit of citric acid in water.Smoke it by putting it on tin foil. Straw overtop, light underneath, inhale when smoke is formed. """"","Positive"

You don't want to come to this, trust me. Smoke it, snort it or plug it but dont fuck with needles, you are just adding serial health risks on it and its more addictive.If you want to smoke it do it on foil, you could see videos posted on internet that teach you how to do it, If you don't have someone to do it for you for sure.And I don't know what type of strange you should get, but surely you should start being really careful with the doses and the way you increase them over time.

544,"Nodding is the same with most opiates pretty much, except fent that shit just makes it impossible to keep eyes open. All opiates give a different euphoria or energetic feeling but the nod is similar. More you do more you‚Äôll nod. Common answer is a match head if you‚Äôre gonna sniff, you can always do more you can never do less, wait about 15 minutes between doses.#4 is the best to snort also easiest to use.  #3 you have to add Citric acid to shoot I‚Äôm pretty sure, and idk how snorting it works but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the same.You should never smoke #4 but people do it all the time.

947,"It's correct that naloxone has very little oral BA and is there to deter iv use. In oral/sublingul use the naloxone isn't what causes the PWs.

1102,"I first read this story at age 17, now I am almost 40... It has always remained in my mind as a story of drugs, depression, and death. It reminds me of my own journey with opiates and my self-destructive nature. I've used my nickname for a long time... I'm getting better, but I could have unlocked that door at any time....It'll only take a moment...Ex Oblivione by H.P. LovecraftWhen the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victim‚Äôs body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples. And always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein.After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well.Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were written many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus.Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence I should never return.But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hoped to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.

1218,"Hey guys, first of all I already understand that I made a mistake relapsing, and there's no real good reason for it so I'll spare the details leading up to that.So anyway, today after a 4 and a half month break, I decided to pick up a couple of bags.  Long story short, I took up a couple of very small shots in a burger king to get a feel for it again, and lo and behold when I got home my syringe had clogged, and I broke it trying to fix it..So I started snorting it, and it just feels like such a waste.  I have no more money, and there's a blizzard out anyway.  I don't even enjoy it that much, it burns the fuck out of my nose (it's probably cut to shit), makes me nauseous, no rush, the whole thing makes me angry.  It makes me wanna pick up again as soon as I can because I couldn't get that satisfying high that I wanted.  Even after a 4 month tolerance break snorting it does almost nothing for me.  Almost.So my question to you guys is; Is there a more effective way to ingest heroin other than snorting or injecting?  Or could I possibly make a syringe?  I still have the broken needle.  Everything is intact, the 'pull back' part with the plunger is just broken in half.  Thanks.  P.S. Sorry if this is somehow against the rules.

Opiates ended up being a good fit because I usually took them at night so they addressed the pain and helped my insomnia - helping my insomnia, in turn, actually helped my pain during the day because fibro can be really aggravated by stress or lack of sleep, etc.  So, fast forward, I'm trying new pain clinics and it has just been a disaster.

If it's a day where I have no responsibilities and can just lay on the floor with my legs propped up over an ottoman to keep my spine flat on a heating pad then it's a lot easier to take less meds than on days when I have to go sit through 3-9 hours of graduate seminars in really shitty, uncomfortable seats.

Personally, and I may get some shit for saying this, but I don't feel that heroin has to be a negative thing in your life, especially if you are using it as a tool instead of using it and being a tool. The two biggest scariest problems you will run into (which you probably already know) are lack of consistency and having to procure it. I read that you have a guy to get it for you, but what if his dealer goes to jail? Or what if both/all three of his dboys just happen to be out at the same time?  Theoretically, you may be able to shrink both these problems by using dnms, but if you did that, you could just buy your oxy. It sounds like you're planning on going the more traditional route of person to person sales.   You're not going to be able to get the same stuff all the time, so you won't know, batch to batch, how much is equal to 15 mg oxy. Sometimes that may be .025, other times .25 (but god damn that would be weak dope!). Because of this, you also won't know how often you will need to re-up. You, of course, can use an amount that is the equivelant of however much oxy it is, but you have to figure out how much that is by experimenting. To try to do this, I would start with tiny little bumps, snorting one every 15 min or so til it felt right. Then, try to split up however much dope you have into the amount that it took to get you there. You will have to keep in mind, however, that it's going to hit you all at once instead of the tiny increases you experienced the first time, and it'll hit you harder because of that.   You are going to do more than you intend on occasion, and it's going to feel good (unless you're really lucky and hate the way feeling good feels).  You're going to have more on hand almost all the time, because for quality control, you're gonna want to buy a fair amount at a time. It won't be in pill form, or even separated out at all, unless you take care to do that. I can tell you that for me, and for most of the people I know, that's where the problems are. I would probably tell myself that, though I have a good idea, for this batch of heroin, how much I should do to just make my pain tolerable and not get high, a little extra isn't going to hurt much- my back pain will be almost entirely gone AND I'll feel pretty good- after all, I have more than enough to last til next week! Why not?!? But if you do this a few times, the amount you are taking for pleasure and a little extra pain relief becomes the amount you need at a bare minimum. This would happen to me (in my theoretical scenario where I am you) a lot. Then the amount bought to last til next week only lasts til the day after tomorrow, and now I need more, and it's different shit than last time so I have to remeasure how much to use out of this batch to get the pain relief I need, oh, and since there's plenty cause I just picked up, I could probably do a little extra and have my back pain all gone, and then I'll feel good! If it were me, this cycle would go on until I was spending more a day than I make a day, just to kill the back pain that 15 mg of oxy used to work for.  I wrote all that out the long way (and in run on sentences) to try to give you an idea of how easy it is to rationalize doing more, and how that is where the problem is. You will tell yourself that you aren't like that, you have more control. You may! But don't expect yourself to. You're probably like most people. You are going to have to assume that you are like the rest of humanity, and take steps to mitigate human nature. The best step that I can think of is having someone you trust, that doesn't use, work with you on it. At least, that way, you will have a sure fire way of knowing when things get out of hand- you'll be lying to your trusted friend and/or going behind their back to procure drugs they don't know you have. You'll have to remind yourself that these aren't things you want to do, but rather things your brain's reward system are tricking you into doing, and take steps from there.   Like I said before, were I in your situation, I would make the switch. However, it can spiral out of control quickly. Please, understand that almost no one thought they'd end up doing things like using needles or sucking dick for drugs. It happens, and it happens to people who thought they could handle it even though other people can't- maybe because they think they don't have an addictive nature, or because they have legitimate pain, or because they didn't get addicted to any other drugs they did, or cause they have amazing will power. It still happens, and you're going into this pretty much accepting that you have/will have a chemical dependence on heroin. Because of this, I can't stress enough, you need to figure out now what behaviors are warning signs, and steps to take when/if you see yourself exhibiting those behaviors.

1323,"*(Obligatory fuck heroin. Don‚Äôt do this. You are shooting yourself in the head)*I see your dilemma. You just want to use it for pain and not the high, but it‚Äôs heroin. Remember that we all begin to use it for pain too. We all stop feeling the high and simply use it not to be sick and in pain. I know you said it‚Äôs not about money but your tolerance to heroin and other opiates will skyrocket. You‚Äôll have to be dosing every few hours for the pain - heroin doesn‚Äôt last very long. There‚Äôs a much better option for pain because it lasts much longer, but I can‚Äôt name it on here (hint: opium). Starting heroin will mean that you‚Äôll soon begin to spend a lot more than you were spending on oxy... some of us are spending over $100 a day just to not get sick. You‚Äôll get there if you stick with heroin. If that still doesn‚Äôt faze you, read on.The other thing about heroin is that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre getting and how strong the product is. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre getting it off the streets otherwise you‚Äôd know where to buy some more oxy. It‚Äôs very, very hard finding pure heroin of the streets. If you know of the other method I‚Äôm talking about, which I cannot name, please please look into it. Someone else mentioned it. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúsketchy‚Äù. It‚Äôs incredibly less dangerous than trusting some random street dealer. You‚Äôll spend a bit more (but you said it‚Äôs not about money), but it‚Äôs a lot easier to find strong, consistently pure product. I have never bought off the streets and I‚Äôve been using for a while.If you go the street route, get a fent test kit (Either way, get one). For each bag, always start with very very small bumps, under 5mg, then take small bumps every 10 mins until you get pain relief. Incase you got something pure or strong, you DO NOT want to rail 50mg at once. You have a low tolerance now anyways, 5mg could get you solid pain relief if you find strong heroin.If you don‚Äôt IV, the effects aren‚Äôt that profound. Especially if you stick to doses for pain. There‚Äôs some small differences between oxy and heroin, but overall, yeah, it‚Äôs the same thing for pain relief. The effects aren‚Äôt the ‚Äúbig bad monster‚Äù part. It‚Äôs everything else.I advise snorting - it lasts a bit longer. The bioavailability is a bit higher. People smoke mostly for the rush. You could also look into plugging. """"","Positive"

1373,"Hey there, occasional lurker here, this is a throwaway acc. and I'd like your thoughts on my situation. I feel like I'm reaching something of a crossroads with my habit. I've been using for over 2 years full time, it would usually equal about 150mg of oxy a week. I get it through doctors and also DNMs (I live in an area its difficult to get). Also there was one occasion where I bought 3g of h that I snorted over about 2 weeks (that was a damn good fortnight haha).Its a relatively low level habit at this stage but still, going without the pills sucks. Recently I just feel like I'm going through it so much quicker then I used to. Meaning I usually run out early and spend several days replacing it with whatever else I can find.  It's getting to the stage where I might as well try and take an extended tolly break or give up and try to buy more heroin.Before you all say its a good time to stop now completely, I've got relatively low level physical disability which causes me some pain and I'm going to need some more surgery soon, its unlikely I'm going to be able to get through this without opiates. And regardless I'm not sure I'd want to. Its helped me a lot through some difficult times the last few years. Ultimately it feels a bit futile to try and get clean for good. But I also realise that swapping over to heroin probably isn't going work out well for me. And at the same time its something I'd almost be excited for. I feel like I'm at my most productive when I'm high and when I'm not I'm just depressed and do fuck all. I'm a bit conflicted at the moment. There's probably only one person I feel like I could talk to this about, he's my psychiatrist. I feel like I can talk to him about pretty much anything, and we have briefly discussed my drug habits.

1438,"For some reason I am pretty sensitive to GABA related drugs like Lyrica and benzos so dose wise your results may vary but I take about 150mg - 300 mg (personally I am not a big fan of Lyrica by itself but then again other people swear up and down it is as good as MDMA, it varies person to person) as a medium dose and around that would also probably be a good first dose to get a feel for the drug. After you feel comfortable with Lyrica's affects just keep experimenting with different doses until you find a dose that suits you. I only really will actively order Lyrica in order to make opiate withdrawals more comfortable (I tend to order no more then 300 mg - 400mg of heroin at a time with breaks of at least 1 week - 2 weeks in-between to avoid withdrawals altogether) because Lyrica is great at getting rid of restless limbs (especially legs), aching bones and muscles, decreases anxiety, helps you sleep (both falling and staying asleep), and reduces or eliminates many more of the worst opiate withdrawal symptoms. As for Lyrica's recreational effects, well like benzos its nice in combination with opiates and also alcohol but these combinations of depressants can be very dangerous so I would recommend against it but if you are gonna do it anyway start off with very small doses of each substance and slowly titrate up until you get where you want to be. You can always take more, but never less.

Let‚Äôs take the law enforcement approach out of this equation, because the ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù has not, nor has it ever, worked.My biggest issue is that none of the folks that seem to be tasked with addressing the opiate epidemic really understand it. None of them are addicts, have experienced what addiction really is, or are empathetic enough to do the deep dive on it.They are politicians, appointees, state or federal employees. The only group who will have the insight to truly be able to start mitigating this situation is former addicts. They understand the problem at every level.  Put together empowered committees of former addicts and take their suggestions.For example, why is the govt cracking down on prescription pain relief and scheduling kratom? Do they think people will just give up? Of course they won‚Äôt, most of them will move to dope/fent. This feeds into the underground economy and the problem gets exponentially bigger.One more thing - treatment access for the middle class: we are the ones who continually get screwed, and this is no exception. Low income people can get covered by Medicaid, rich folks can afford rehab. Middle class users fall through the cracks. I have worked full time my entire life, always paid into the system. But when I was getting clean I was shit out of luck. I have BS govt marketplace insurance, hundreds per month paid out of pocket. No way could I afford rehab, and I‚Äôm too old to hit my parents up.

1813,"i like to use saline nasal spray when I snort anything. You can buy it at most stores that have allergy medication. it's literally just disinfected salt water in a spray bottle and its a good way to both prep your sinuses before you snort anything, getting the drugs moist when they're  in your nose, and will also help clear up some congestion in there when you;re clogged up.What I'll do is do a light spray right before I snort my line, then do another spray after it goes in there to help them dissolve. It will definitely help absorption fo you, especially with your shit being crusty like you seem to be describing. just make sure you spray it lightly cause you don't want it to be so wet that things start dripping down your throat. It's really cheap, especially compared to a medicated spray like afrin.If I don't have any saline spray then i'll just get two fingers wet and stick them in my nose to get it moist, before the line and after, just like the spray and it seems to worrk almost as well. Like I said, the point is to get your nose damp so that the dope doesn't juwt clump up in dryed out viigers.Also, another tip, smaller and thinner lines helps with absorption, and avoind snorting hard so the dope doesn't just fly into your throat. a line can get up there with the same kind of inhale as when you're breathing normally. I see so many people, especially coke heads, snorting lines hard as fuck and they'll even cough out a bit of powder lol. Railing lines like that just wastes it, """"","Positive"

1815,"Hi all.   I am not 100% sure this is the best place for the post and I did read the rules of the sub and will try to keep this post in accordance to them.   But I need HELP.   I have been clean for about two years with the help of suboxone.   I have not been getting the subs through an MD but rather from the same person I‚Äôve always gone through.   However, I‚Äôm now pregnant and so I have stopped taking the suboxone and really need to get on subutex.    The problem is that nobody has it which means I‚Äôll need to go to a dr to get it.    That‚Äôs Perfectly fine with me except the problem is I CANT FIND ONE.    I know, I know, there are tons of provided websites and so forth but I‚Äôm on state insurance (your all shocked I‚Äôm sure lol) and the only places that take that insurance are treatment centers.     I am not against treatment but everyone I‚Äôve talked to will require me to go through OPT as if I was just getting clean.    Frankly, I don‚Äôt have time in my life for that right now and tbh don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs necessary.    But if I go anywhere else they want like $300-400 for an office visit!   I can‚Äôt afford that at the moment.    I‚Äôd LOVE to say I‚Äôm totally fine and I‚Äôll wait a few weeks until I can go to one of those Drs, but we all know how this thing works and I don‚Äôt want to take any chances here.   It‚Äôs not just my body that I have to thing about- ya dig?   So I desperately need to know if there is a way for me to find a Dr that takes state insurance that provides Rx that is not a treatment center.   (The one on the east side shut her doors recently) I know I can‚Äôt ask for specifics but even just a resource to find specifics would be awesome.    Without being too specific about location I‚Äôll just say that I‚Äôm in the Pacific Northwest- Landia.     Please please help- PM me- comment.    Anything.

1878,"**Confidence interval**In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate (of a population parameter) that is computed from the observed data. The confidence level is the frequency (i.e., the proportion) of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of their corresponding parameter. In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level in an infinite number of independent experiments, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will match the confidence level.Confidence intervals consist of a range of values (interval) that act as good estimates of the unknown population parameter.*****Standard deviation**In statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma œÉ or the Latin letter s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.The standard deviation of a random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance. It is algebraically simpler, though in practice less robust, than the average absolute deviation.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/opiates/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 """"","Positive"

If I got good quality shit in a ‚Äòblock‚Äô as you described earlier, could it still be cut with fent despite visually appearing very pure? Or is cut dope usually easy to spot?Thanks again, your help is much appreciated!  """"","Positive"
1955,"Thanks. Yeah I‚Äôve always followed the ‚Äòcan do more but not less‚Äô approach with all drugs. Only loosely relevant, but I have a friend that IV‚Äôs meth. He buys .1 at a time, and no matter how good or bad the shit looks, he will never do half now half later.. he always does the lot in one go.. because he‚Äôs only buying the one decent dose he says it‚Äôs a waste to do it half and half because you get less of a rush than all at once.. stupid, but makes sense I guess.. in fact, he spent a week in hospital recently after clogging his arm with a point of rock salt. But yeah, working up slowly from a low dose is definitely the way to go with street drugs especially. Thanks again for the advice, I can‚Äôt stress enough how much I appreciate you taking the time to help out as much as you have.. I‚Äôm confident now , and will probably be a safe, informed, and happy heroin addict soon enough. Much love and best wishes for the rest of your day. Peace.   """"","Positive"

1964,"Not at all, it‚Äôs better to ask questions than to blindly go into it. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs difficult to overdose. However if done in small increments you should be safe, (assuming it‚Äôs not cut with fent and there are no hotspots) to put it into perspective I‚Äôve seen someone rail 3 bags and be completely fine, then rail one 3 hours later and go into respiratory failure because of a hotspot. A LOT of ODs are people who have been clean for some time and then jump back in thinking that because when they were using they used to shoot a gram they‚Äôll be fine sniffing a half gram. If you have no tolerance follow the micro dosing waiting to see how you feel every 15-20 minutes you‚Äôll be fine.   By The way if you don‚Äôt have a scale .025 is about the size of a match head.Another anecdote, first time I tried H I got some relatively clean dope (not pure, but not cut with fent). And I got 3 bags deep before I passed out, woke up next morning throwing up, but I didn‚Äôt OD. Edit: sorry didn‚Äôt answer first question no passing out definitely does not always mean respiratory failure. OD is a relative term, you‚Äôre not prescribed heroin so any amount you do is overdosing what you should be doing.

2042,"A couple weeks ago I was rummaging through the medicine cabinet and found a nearly-full bottle of oxycodone pills from when I broke my leg four years ago. I still remember the rush I felt on seeing it--after reading through trip reports on Erowid, I was convinced that I had discovered the perfect drug. I took some, felt nice and relaxed, but craved something stronger. I was thinking about drastically increasing my dose for next time, but decided to do some research first. At this point the possibility of addiction had never once crossed my mind.Of course, after reading the experiences of addicts, I quickly learned how insidiously addictive opiates are. The worst part is that I know exactly what it‚Äôs like to feel like your rational self has no control over your impulses--on a smaller scale, obviously, but my weaknesses are internet (reddit especially) and food. So I can be pretty confident of an opiate habit in my future if I ever get used to this oxycodone. Sometimes I convince myself that my supply is limited, but clearly that‚Äôs not true if I want more strongly enough.So far my fear has kept me from taking more, but my desire has kept me from throwing it away. I‚Äôve ended up in a state of obsessively ‚Äúsaving it for later.‚Äù I‚Äôll take out the bottle when I get home from school, stare at the pills, count them, sit next to the toilet and contemplate flushing them away, and in the end return them to languishing silently in my closet.

Is my life really so pathetic that I can‚Äôt think of living it without a chemical crutch? I probably need some guidance on how to seek out long-term, non-artificial happiness.But the temptation, oh, the temptation. Happiness in a bottle‚Ä¶ of course I would never want to be dependent on something like that, but it can‚Äôt hurt to just experience it, just once, or several times, and even then it‚Äôs not like I could never get more, I would just have to look in the right places‚Ä¶ and the struggle continues.

Even if you staggered the 2 throughout the day, your daily dose would not go above 20mg.What I said was wrong was ordering an extended release drug to be taken every 2 hours. MS Contin lasts 12 hours, and the peak concentration isn't even released until 3-4 hours after taking it, so you would be taking the next dose before the 1st dose was even fully felt.

""""","Positive"
2338," As I have already clarified to you twice. You should not take an ER drug as needed, IF the frequency is before the duration in which the dose is effective. If you take a med like Oxymorphone ER, it takes time for the dose to release and for you to feel the max effect in your body. In those 1st few hours, it would not be medically advisable to take repeated additional doses of Oxymorphone ER. If you take 2 pill at the same time to make a higher strength, or take an additional tablet each day as the drug wears off that is normal, and NOT what I was referring to. Pain after you have taken your ER dose is considered breakthrough pain. This is more appropriately treated with IR pain meds, which work immediately. Taking additional ER meds is dumb and dangerous during those first few hours. It's dumb because the extra doses will still take hours to work, and it's dangerous because if done repeatedly it can cause a cumulative toxicity. I have been very clear my example was about taking an ER drug every  2 hrs. If your so sure I am wrong, go pay your doctor to explain it to you. """"","Positive"

I've always been looking for a way to reduce animal suffering directly instead of doing activism. Anyways, I thought about giving farm animals opiates during stressful period of the animal's life. Like during transport, slaughter and the stealing and ''rape'' of the animals. Tramadol seem to be the best opiate for this since it's long lasting. It's already used in africa because it makes the animals more docile. I'm sure big pharma will be pleased to have new ''customers'' to sell to. It's a win-win-win-win situation IMO.

2836,"Ive worked on fish farms and in the US for Division of Wldlife. The drugs approved for use on fish are very limited and the laws governing their use are not flexible. I doubt there is much difference regarding terrestrial animals. For example, oxytetracycline, which is fairly innocuous and widely available without a prescription cannot be used on animals for a period of time before harvest. In the case of fish it‚Äôs two weeks. It cannot be present in the tissues of the animal past a certain threshold and each harvest is tested.Furthermore, getting a new drug approved is next to impossible. First you‚Äôd have to present convincing data to the FDA or AADAP to persuade them that tramadol should be used ‚Äúoff label‚Äù to reduce anxiety and that the residual tramadol present in the tissues wouldn‚Äôt be a potential hazard to consumers. I don‚Äôt mean to be negative, but that isn‚Äôt going to happen. There were five drugs I could legally used to farm fish. One of them was NaCl and another was I2, salt and iodine.

Win win for the government, or a proxy of the government or the illuminate or cthulhu. What ever the case, its getting more popular because dealers can make more money, the users get more high and tolerances grow and people get more reckless.

We took a 8-11week break after the few binges, the last one being before the halfway point of summer. Then we started chipping, using once a week, usually 40-150mg used between us per session (most of the time all nighters because oxy keeps us awake)We succesfully chipped until january, but started using almost daily in early january. Its now the night between saturday and sunday and we last used on wednesday so we managed to go to school. This is the only break longer than 1day we have had since early january.Thursday and friday we just laid on the sofa as we couldnt get ourselves up and felt super depressed, have been taking a little bit of benzos to make it more bearable.We were supposed to get an OC80 tonight but the dealer stopped answering, mayby this is a sign to continue not using, mayby not.

3745,"At least you and your SO have each other! I'd say it would be VERY smart to stretch these off days out for a while, like a few weeks, even if you aren't ready to quit entirely at this point. Use this time to drop your tolerance and stop the daily dosing schedule - go back to a less junky-ish relationship with the drug. This of course is a path that will lead you back to where you are now, but it's at least a temporary improvement, and has big upsides in terms of finances and not having to obsessively plan everything you do around drugs! But it also doesn't sound like you guys are having that much fun being hooked on oxy. Why not experiment with quitting? You guys are on day three, you're so so close. Every day from here will get better, and from there it's this awesome steady improvement, and that feeling is fucking amazing. (It's the pink cloud that recovery people talk about, and it's def a real feeling.) Anyway, that's one guy's suggestions! I'm currently not clean, but like a lot of people on this sub I have been exactly where you are and getting clean has never once felt like a mistake -- even if I always seem to eventually justify popping another pill or whatever because this time I'll handle it better!

3754,"I know this in opiates. I‚Äôm more familiar/trust you guys.I deleted my long dramatic posts..because they‚Äôre long and dramatic.TLDR of the other post: boyfriend got sent to rehab, he has all the connects and I don‚Äôt have my car. I manage to get one of our dboys by commenting my number on his Venmo..I Was supposed to get my car back Friday. They say maybe it‚Äôll be ready Tuesday. My boyfriend gets out Wednesday. I do not want to make him relapse. I hope I can even see him. His dad called me this morning, telling me not to go near him. That I‚Äôm no longer welcome in the house. That I‚Äôll get over it, I‚Äôm 18, and should go do some homework.They don‚Äôt know I use. Like I‚Äôm clean to them. Maybe they think I‚Äôm the reason he relapsed. I wasn‚Äôt. He was using When I met him. If anything he‚Äôs the main reason I got addicted..guess I‚Äôll just have to wait until he gets out and see how things go. Thinking about sending them a fucking edible arrangement. I‚Äôm sick. I had three bags, they got wet. Desperately left it out to dry, scraped it. Soaked the bags in water and boofed it. Water turned brown so I got something out of it... even shoved the fucking wet bag up my ass. Fucking pathetic.I got this kid to drive me to (nj city were dope is sold) yesterday. Only he crashed his car on the way to my fucking house.Today I got this girl who doesn‚Äôt use to drive me. Straight up told her what was gonna happen.I call my dboy, straight to voicemail. Five calls and thirty minutes later he picks up. 300 dollars (100 from the original kid who was going to drive) for 70 bags. Fair. Whatever. I‚Äôve never copped alone though. I‚Äôm scared honestly. I have the worst luck. It‚Äôs like the universe is preventing me from getting this dope. Or being happy.I‚Äôve never been this suicidal before. I know that‚Äôs bad to say. Especially since I‚Äôve had multiple suicide attempts. So it‚Äôs going to be hard not to purposely use 7/8/9/10 bags just to... make this stop. Maybe I‚Äôm naive and young. But I‚Äôm hurting so badly. I‚Äôve reached out to everyone I could think of... I begged my mom to bring me to my psychiatrist, they didn‚Äôt answer, I begged her to bring me to the hospital...written off as dramatic. A bunch of my gabapentin got wet along with my bags (a water bottle spilled in my purse). So I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôll work but I must have taken about 15-20 if not more. (100mg each). It won‚Äôt kill me but I wish it fucking would.I understand I am dramatic. I‚Äôm scared because I‚Äôm alone and without my boyfriend. I‚Äôm always with him. I‚Äôm terribly attached to him and miss him dearly. I‚Äôve never been in love the way I am with him. And now everything is against us. I‚Äôd like to think he‚Äôd pick me over his family. He‚Äôs very mad at them. But in reality... they will kick him out. He has no choice. I don‚Äôt know how much I can take. I‚Äôve been suffering for six years from mental illness. I get no relief. Ever. No medication, no therapy, no iop... I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm biologically fit to be alive.Anyway I guess the main question... I took .5mg of xanax today in attempt to stop my mind from racing. My heart pounding. The intense fucking anxiety and constant daydreaming of overdosing. Maybe it took the edge off. I‚Äôm not getting fucking shit out of it.So, if I were to crush up some Xanax and boof it... would it work? I guess chemically, I‚Äôm not even looking to get high, I‚Äôd love to get high, but I want to be able to take .5-.75 and just.. get the most out of it. I don‚Äôt know what will make it most worth my while.Any advice on copping too... as far as I‚Äôm concerned I call, go where he says, he walks up to the car and it‚Äôs  quick exchange, then I high tail the fuck out of that place. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just nervous.If anyone would like to talk by the way... please pm me. I know it‚Äôs desperate. I feel so alone. I‚Äôve been sitting in my bed for days... I couldn‚Äôt even tell you the last time I ate. I just feel sick. I feel like I‚Äôm dying. Nothing gives me joy...I cry and sleep all day. The minutes drag on. I can‚Äôt fucking take this.By tonight I‚Äôll have my dope if everything goes well. And then I‚Äôll have to feel better...right? Oh god. I need to.I don‚Äôt know how much I can take anymore.

You could also have damaged your heart from this, so an echocardiogram and EKG would be a helpful test to have done as well.  If something funky is going on with your heart you could probably get meds.  There are so many things that could be going wrong that the brain regulates like hormones that you need to know about to improve the quality of life that you have left.

It's kind of a partial depersonalization/derealization or delusional state.I've been thru shit where I was absolutely certain I would die, and just kinda sorta accepted death. Mostly eating disorder related I have a very unhealthy relationship towards food. The only thing eating related I haven't struggled with is binge eating. Never been A binge eater. Ever. But, I have gone thu periods of purging via vomiting (even though I usually only ate like 600-800 cal (nowhere near an execessive amount of food) before purging, it still felt like the food was something I need to get rid of), purging thru excessive exercise (to be clear I'm talking 3+ hours a day of moderate-intense exercise, sometimes 5 straight hours on my stationary bike), extreme restriction (when my Ed began I was just a 13 yr old girl, and183 lbs. Completely naive to EDs. In fact I don't think I ever heard of any of them til I started like researching my symptoms/what I was thinking and found out that eating disorders are a thing. I wish I could go back in time and prevent the eating disorder.....  Anyways I dropped to like 145-150 (can't remember the exact number) in 2-3 months from eating maybe 50-200 cals a day. Was horrible. And there begins my obsession and addiction to losing weight and calorie counting, that carries on to this day), fasting (self explanatory), laxatives, etc. To expand on the diff. Phases of the ED, I was clinically bulimic for a few months near the end of 2016, during which my electrolytes were obviously becoming more and more imbalanced. My heart would rattle in my chest. It felt like it was vibrating. The ekg was terrifying and convinced me to stop purging. Hadn't thought about this but I haven't purged regularly in almost a year (I think). Yay. Shits horrible I'm so glad to be free of my purging habit. Also, I've been a hardcore restrictor im talking 100-500 calories/day for weeks. Ive had maybe 5 of these episodes since I was 13. I would feel like I was dying or at least like I might faint. I've reached 107 lbs before. It happened to be right before I went to rehab. For someone my height (5'3) I was so close, so so soo close to being underweight that it felt surreal. It did not feel Ike my life was my own. I could not believe that this former obese fuck actually is now bordering on underweight. If I had pictures of both versions of me, I'd post them for reference.But anyway. I'm 120 lbs right now and while I'd like to lose like 20 lbs I'm trying to be less obsessed with weight loss and calories and just trying to take it easy. I actually find that it's harder to lose weight the more obsessive you are about it and the more time you spend thinking about food /weight loss. I'm trying to just be accepting of how I look right now (I even have a fairly flat stomach and also a small thigh gap) so less of my energy goes towards my disordered thoughts like \you should eat less than 250 calories a day until you're 110 lbs!\"" or \""measure your thighs and waist every day to make sure they aren't getting bigger\"".

4548,"Here is the story. I'm on a LONG sub taper. At this point 1/2 milligram every morning when I wake up between 7 and 9. Most of the time, I'm fine. But once or twice a month, I get a vicious headache. This used to happen when I was using other opiates too. With heroin I just assumed it was a cut or I took too much, and with pills I assumed it was dosage related, but with the subs, I cut my strips into 16 equal pieces with an exacto, so it shouldn't be happening. I've thought of everything, what and when I eat, cigarette and coffee consumption before during and after dosing. Nothing seems to clearly be the problem.I've heard that the bupe could be unevenly laid across the strips, so if I had access to 2mg strips maybe that would help, but if they were so uneven as to give me headaches like I've taken too much, it seems like sometimes I'd get them unevenly doses in the opposite direction and they wouldn't totally stave off withdrawal.Does this happen to anyone else?

It's been a week since I told him to take less but he does not listen to meThe material is much better than what he usually took, I warned him several times but he does not really understand.So he took two shots at maybe 30 min interval (maximum), the first was ok for his tolerance, but the second was too big, I think.I see him immediately nodding with the syringe in his hand (removed from the arm) so I took it and put it in a trash and I realized that it was too much for him (before that I had not seen how much he put in his shot he told me later). 1-2 min later, he goes to my couch, goes to bed, I watch him and suddenly he makes a strange noise as if he wants to inspire but can not then I shook him and slapped him, at first, he does not react eventually he woke up relatively quickly 15-30sec I think maybe more difficult to say in this condition. After that, he kept nodding and I looked at him insistently, asking him to breathe deeply and to occupy him to prevent him from nodding again. After taking a small line of coke (on my advice) to wake him up. But he was still stone,T + 1h30 He wants to go home, I have withheld 1 hour but finally he goes away. In my opinion it's ok but I'm still worried, so I told him to put his phone on the max volume and I told him I'll call you in 15-30-60min and if he does not answer I'll come with naloxone.Do you think there is still a risk for him to stop breathing?

But I have a strict rule that I follow, and have only broken less than 5 times in those last 6-8 months. My rule is that I only allow myself to spend $20 max on dope per day, which is how much half a gram costs. I can either do one shot for the whole day of the whole half g all at once, or do multiple smaller shots through out the day. Regardless of how I dose, even if I shook the whole half g in one shot, I‚Äôm not gonna get high - so it‚Äôs just about how bad my needle fetish is that day, and how many times I wanna shoot up that day. But I basically never break that rule, not even to buy a second bag and get high. It keeps me from developing an even higher tolerance and ending up spending tons of money a day getting actually fucked up. This rule keeps me spending just a minimal, small amount of money per day. And a lot of the time I don‚Äôt even do the full half g a day - I‚Äôll do less than that. Because I don‚Äôt do more than half a g, my tolerance doesn‚Äôt increase and I can stay well and keep from getting dopesick just by using only one point per day. So it works pretty well. I‚Äôve got pretty good self control because of my rule. Even on days when I can afford to and do buy multiple bags, I still don‚Äôt let myself use more than my allotted half g for the day.

So New Years passes and I think I really need to stop and take 3 days off work leading into the weekend, but of course my family finds out and requests my help for errands which I can't be sick for so I end up copping. So I plan a future date where i can take more days off. A few days pass, and the days turn to weeks, and weeks to months. I keep telling myself, next weekend will be perfect, but you have so much things going on, you can't find the time to take off. And I can't go to detox because insurance sucks, and if I was gone for that many days with no contact from family, or possible work related issue where I can't reply, then they might know something's up. Sometimes I keep thinking I'll just take another 2-3 days off, BUT what if I relapse, my paycheck will be only for the 2 days I work. I somehow think that I might as well just work the full 5 days and use dope then take the risk of working only 2 days, relapsing and not having money for bills or more dope. I'll just wait until a paid Holiday. So the Holiday comes on a Monday and it's Saturday and I really put my foot down. I even bought a have a few sub strips. I make it to Sunday which is around 36 hours since last use and take a small part of sub, but a few moments later go into Precipitated Withdrawals. Damn it! After only 15 minutes, I think it's unbearable  and justify using once and will redose the sub again later. End up using again... Less than a month now until summer and it's been all excuses why I couldn't stop. The last few weeks before vacation are just a repeat of what happened before. So the vacation a few days out and still haven't quit. I used up to the same day and just bought subs with me and said F it. Ended up getting PWD which sucked for 2.5 days until I adjusted. 2 weeks of subs and finally return home but subs run out.. End up buying dope again. So in theory I'd want to quit and be sober if 2020 was the last year before the world ends, but reality is more difficult.

I wonder how pathetic it is to use and how those who say they're functioning are just lying to themselves. If they could function they wouldn't actually need drugs. I feel you on the skinny part too. Addiction is a horrible disease and this drug is as shitty as it gets. However I will say that I felt my best when I decided to stop using dope as an excuse in my life for shit reasons( losing weight, feeling empty, being an asshole) and started to actively change the shitty reasons I did dope for. I started running and eating better( still bulimic/ not eating enough but I'm trying) and I started doing small things just to better my life( go to a park every weekend, get a job, etc). I still do dope but I don't let it slip past buying .3 every few days or so and then popping a sub to keep me stable for some time. The only way to stop feeling pathetic is to tackle the things that make you feel that way and change them because YOU want to change. I hope you find a way to feel better and do better. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. I really hope you do well üíñ!   """"","Positive"

I know you guys don't judge so I'll say it I went online found a nasty looking prostitute and asked her if she's get me some dope if I payed her. I got some China. Knowing it was fent since it ain't tar, I did the tiniest key bump. Barely got high. Then me and my fiance argued cause she seen my eyes. I drove to my mom's for the night. I couldn't fall asleep so I thought I'll take another bump. Literally small as fuck to be safe cause I know it's dangerous. Don't feel that high but I'm well. I went to sleep, woke up in the ICU. My mom found me 10 hours later is what happened how i lived that long idk.The shit had bupe in it I wander if that's why I didn't feel like it was strong. Anyways it was the aspiration pneumonia that almost got me. When i came back i couldnt hear they said they had to do life support. I woke up early a few times so they strapped me to the bed. Sepsis set in. White blood cells dropped. Drs  couldnt say if I'd live. They said I'd be on the breathing machine for at least 5 days. I woke up after 3 full recovery. Also the breathing machine u can't actually feel your lungs expand from the air so it feels like your not breathing which fucks your mind. Anyways I was good then relapsed 2 months later. Now I'm a 2 days on 5 days off chipper with strictly tar. Wish I could stop but for the first time I ha e a plug and not middles.Edit: I love you guys. Be careful everyone I don't know how I could have been more careful. They were almost guanteeing me I'd need dialysis at least after it all but by the grace of God I recovered fast. The doctors were literally amazed. I was scared when I woke up while getting life support to 8-12 doctors around me looking scared. One was holding my hand in tears.

116,"I was addicted to crack and it's really hard to quit. It's all mental and really addictive. And it's not even that great of a high, it lasts mere seconds. I would spend a lot a day.

I know it's not easy but it's possible. Right now, it's your choice - do you want to keep using and lose your girlfriend and the gated house community? Crack will rape your bank account and soul until nothing is left. Crack raped my bank account in a day more than heroin ever did to me.        All you can do is walk away. The withdraws are only mental. Walk away and find a hobby that is time consuming - like video games - play Fortnite - it's a really addictive game that can be time consuming. You need something to get your mind off of it. Maybe try NA meetings, it might just work for you and/or get a sponser you can talk to when you get intense cravings.       The cravings and mental part are the worse. But a craving is just a craving and it will pass. It's been a couple years since I danced with cack for two months and I never think about it anymore. I promise it gets better in time. Cut the dealer out of your life, delete the number, flush the phone. You will lose eveything if you keep indulging in the crack - it's up to you, right now, to decide if you want to smoke crack while everything falls apart around you or man up and kick crack out of your life, count your blessings that you still have a roof over your house and invest your time, energy and money into more healthy and  productive hobbies.     Sorry for the long spill, I didn't see any other people that are using crack or have previously use crack so I wanted to give you some insight on how I quit.

You've picked up the pieces many times out of the dust and repaired your life. It's not worth wasting time just to lose everything again. You can do it. You can quit. All you have to do is quit.

348,"This is a terrible idea.  Junkies will be junkies, but the risk for infection is absolutely not worth injecting into the groin/femoral vein.  Even the feet should be done carefully with the risk of deep vein thrombosis being that much higher, and if the person has diabetes that is asking to lose a foot. """"","Negative"
349,"Incoming harm reduction rant:  Take care when injecting into your feet.  Clean the site VERY well since our feet are pretty dirty, and if you have diabetes or are pre diabetic do not inject into your feet AT ALL.  Diabetics normally have some form of peripheral vascular disease, and injecting here can cause a deep vein thrombosis or ‚Äúblood clot‚Äù that can travel to the brain, heart, or lungs and kill you.  Wound healing in the diabetic foot is also extremely delayed, and people lose their feet all the time.  Also, I would stay away from the groin/femoral vein because it is the dirtiest site to inject on the body, and the risk for infection is extremely high.  Doctors don‚Äôt even put femoral central lines in much anymore because even with surgical aseptic technique it is still a huge infection control issue.  You can also get blood clots injecting here, and worse an infection that goes systemic and kills you (sepsis).  Even with alcohol swabs it is not enough, and with such close proximity to the femoral artery it is not worth it.  The neck is hit or miss depending on what vein you decide to use.  Obviously from a harm reduction aspect the neck is not advised for infection reasons as well, but not as bad as the feet or groin.  Missing a shot in your neck could be very bad.  The only vein that should be attempted in the neck is the EXTERNAL jugular, because it is far enough away from the carotid arteries (you have 2 PAIRS of carotids).  Please be careful.  The INTERNAL jugular is too close to the arteries, and doctors have to use ultrasound machines to hit these veins.  DO NOT ATTEMPT.  If I were you I would stop shooting pills.  If you don‚Äôt use a micron filter your lungs are being filled with insoluble materials that will scar the alveoli, you will lose elasticity, and eventually get a form of lung disease that I can‚Äôt name off the top of my head.  These are just some of the risks of what you are attempting to do.  Use some other ROA for a while until your body bounces back a bit (if it ever does), and good luck on your journey.  If you intend to proceed anyway at least now you know some of the risks and can weigh them versus the rewards.  All of our IV journeys must come to an end someday whether it be from over use, getting clean/using other ROA, or dieing from an OD or other complication related to dirty IV practices(bacterial infection, viruses like HIV/HEP, lung disease, etc..).  Stay safe. """"","Negative"

And seriously, it's a lot fucking better for you than your jugular.. Peace and good luck man.. Let me know if you need any advice on how to flag the femoral.. """"","Negative"
352,"I really don't intend to sound curt but unless you have experience injecting into your femoral vein, what do you know? One is prone to infection anywhere they inject; you are fucking injecting drugs that, most of the time, have been stomped on by numerous people with numerous different agents. As long as you take care of the femoral vein, as in: using a clean EVERY TIME, using a alcohol pad before and after on the injection site, and just not doing dumb shit like injecting things like welbutrin you can use your femoral vein literally as long as you live. Again, no offense man but i get sick of people saying that shit.

354,"Are you sure you used all the veins in your hand? I thought I was completely out of veins there but I've been currently using the tiny tiny veins on the palm side of my hand. I'm not talking about the bigger ones on the actual palm, but the tiny tiny ones above it, and below the fingers (all of them below the index to the pinky). Like I've shot in a lot of different spots on one hand alone, which i never thought possible until I read someone else using their actual fingers and thought if they could hit that, i can hit these tiny ones. Just have to be very careful and slow. Sometimes it does burn alittle, but i've never had a huge lump so I'm not sure about that part. You are shooting H right?   Also, there are more veins in the hand then I thought. When I stopped using the visible ones, I would find deeper veins by using  one hand to rub the area i'm considering shooting in and it'll turn white for half a second, and i can get a visual to see if there are any light blue lines where theres a possible vein, and shoot there. Sometimes I use a pen just to dot the spot where i saw the vein because it won't be visible just by looking at your hand. But only after you rub it kind of like when you wash your hands and apply pressure you can see the veins very lightly.   I know that isn't about your feet but hope that can help you out. Good luck.

So my boyfriend, my really close friend Zack, and I are driving on the freeway to go cop some tar. We see this Prius up ahead and they have no lights on it‚Äôs 11pm and they almost hit the center divider. We‚Äôre like oh shit dude this person is hella fucked up. We started recording this drunk driver because this was the craziest driving we‚Äôve ever seen. Driver was zigzagging across the entire freeway. We followed her 10 minutes down the freeway and she almost hit two cars, eventually she hit a guard rail blowing out her tire. She gets off the next exit and at the stoplight Zack gets out, runs to her car pounding on her window and she skirts around the corner.  She drives over a center divider, rocks going everywhere and dirt in the air, she pulls into a Chevron and we park right behind her. Zack runs back up to her car and rips the door open and was like what the fuck are you doing?! Ironically one of our other junkie friends was at the gas station too and he and his girlfriend walk up and think we hit this girl in a fender bender? All these nosy people come up and think it was a fender bender but they leave after we tell them we got this handled.   This one chick stayed behind to help out. We find out there‚Äôs a service dog in the vehicle and that‚Äôs when I got really mad. This girl was blonde, had tattoos, total Cali girl cause that‚Äôs where we are. She try‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs from Istanbul, speaking Spanish with a British accent. Yeah, I‚Äôm not even fucking joking üòÇ this bitch wasn‚Äôt even making sense. She was saying they don‚Äôt have center dividers in her country lol and trying to convince us that she was foreign so bad. The girl who stayed back to help was calling her own AAA to get the car towed but the drunk driver was pretending she didn‚Äôt know the address. She just kept spurting out numbers in Spanish with her British accent. The drunk girl is now just saying random stupid shit trying to say her fianc√© is on his way and he owns a taxi company. I tell the girl who stayed back she can leave we got it handled.   At this point I‚Äôm so close to knocking this chick the fuck out. She‚Äôs just saying all this dumb shit and she walks up to Zack and hugs him and says Te Amo. Then she proceeds to do that to me but kisses me on my face and says Te Amo. She goes up to my boyfriend and hugs him and says Te Amo. We ask her about her service dog and we let it out of the car. Her dog was 3 and it was so skinny it looked starving! It was so fucking sad. I just walked away after this because I was about to knock her out. Only reason I didn‚Äôt was because cops kept driving by. Eventually I look out the car window when I‚Äôm in the car and I see Zack and my boyfriend talking to a cop. I get out and walk up to them. The cop asks if any of us would give a written statement. Zack apologizes to the cop and says sorry officer I just dont give info to cops I hope you understand. I volunteer and tell him I‚Äôll give one. I follow him to his cop car and he asks me what happen and I start writing the statement. Cops give her a sobriety field test and she‚Äôs failing terribly. She‚Äôs lying and still going with her story. I overhear the cops saying there‚Äôs also a cat in the car! Jesus Christ poor animals. There‚Äôs 5 cops there and finally a 6th comes with a blood testing kit cause she demanded them to test her blood. She gets cuffed and off to jail. Animals get taken to the shelter. We leave. We finally cop.   Sidenote: I had two cousins suffer from drunk driving incidents. They were brother and sister. One cousin died on her way to prom when she was 18. She was passenger and the driver was drunk. My other cousin was passenger too. He was in a coma and has never been the same since. I got hit by a drunk driver just in October. He hit me three times!

Idk if I went by myself in bed or if my mom or brother put me in there. They only said that I was really drunk but they dont know about my use. And one time about 6 month ago I had some shitty street dope I had to use 3 bags thats a g just to feel well. In that week when I had to use that shit I took my whole diazepam stash. I had a stash with about 5 blisters of the 10mg diaz pills. At the end of that week I only had 2 blisters left. I used at work every 4 hours a bag plus a diaz. On friday I took 2 bags and a diaz once at work. When I came home. My mom told me that I will be alone today at home. So I thought this will be a good chance to get high as a kite. So I snorted 3 bags and popped 3 pills. Half a hour later I was walking through the house like I drank the whole night. And everytime I am in such a state I cant stop taking pills. So I popped 2 more. 2 hours later I woke up in the basement lying near the steps. I felt down 30 steps with my ice cream. There were ice cream everywhere I also had some choclate sauce. That was a night. The best part is that the only injurie I had was the broken ice cream. RIP ice cream. Lol. Now a days I just use benzos for wds.

1194,"Hi all, first of all I'd like to say I've never used drugs much less an opiate which is why I've come here to ask this question to people who might hopefully know the answer. My boyfriend died of a heroin overdose on January 14th, I found him on the 17th because him not responding for 3 days was odd so I went over to his apartment, no spare key in the box and he had the deadbolt locked, had to have the police kick in the door. By the time we got in there, he was already decomposing because he had the heat turned up to 95 degrees, I'm wondering if using drugs (I found out later on that in the weeks leading up to this that he was also using crack and meth) would cause him to turn the heat up that much? I'm waiting on the tox report to see what exactly he had in his system but also I was wondering if heroin stacks? Like he would have used it as soon as he got it, and then when he got home probably 2 hours later and used again, if the first time he used meant it didn't have fentanyl in it, would his overdose be caused by injecting too close in time together as in when he got it, when he got home and then probably again at home? Apologies if I'm not making sense or worded it confusing, I just feel like my mind is going crazy looking for answers I may never get. His overdose was an accident, not intentional because of him telling me that morning see you Tuesday and then thru text message later that day that he found a new halfway house that he was going to move into at the end of January and he was excited to get clean again and get back on the right track.

So a few days went by and I seemed to be okay, but now I'm getting these weird fevers again coupled with a horribly migraine that won't go away unless I'm totally in the dark. Anybody know what this could possibly be? For example, I took a shot about an hour ago, now I'm under 3 blankets cold as fuck, my head is pounding, and my whole body aches.

Now that day my mom decided to come by to say hi unannounced, and if she hadn't.. well I'd be dead right now.   She took me to the hospital just to try and get me some help, that's when I found out I was septic and dehydrated.   The next 4 days was a ton of IV fluids and powerful antibiotics. Then on day 5 when I was hoping to try and go home with a antibiotic script I was told that I also had Rhabdomyolysis as well as being septic and there was. No way I was going home. 7 days total in the hospital.if my mom didn't show up that day I would've either died from the blood infection(sepsis) or my kidneys would've failed due to not treating the rhabdomyolysis in time. And I just blamed withdrawals for how I was feeling, it's been 2 weeks since I got out of the hospital and the doctor wanted me to rest literally that whole time but I couldn't and it was and still is incredibly hard to even do everyday things without getting tired so quickly and constantly having to really try to do shit that shouldn't phase me at all is an experience of its own.

1558,"So I have a couple of questions about using subs for detox and was wondering if anyone could help me out.  First a little bit of background, been using opiates on and off for about 3 years, with my using turning heavy in the last year. I will typically go on 2-4 week binges, withdraw and binge again. Before Christmas I overdid it with Tianeptine sulfate and experience awful withdrawals (I have heard it has some of the worst) thankfully I managed to make it through them, but it almost cost me my sanity.   Of course after that I vowed never to take opiates again, just a bit of kratom so that I could enjoy New Years eve, and not be feeling to terrible as I settled into my new job. Well that obviously didn't last long and I've been abusing a long last opiate daily/once every 2 days for a month and a half (equivalent to maybe 300mg morphine or more). . I know a month is not a long time, but I haven't fully withdrawn from opiates in over 6 months. The longest I have gone without is a week but I wasn't out of withdrawals then.    I am positively terrified of the withdrawals, I am very bad at handling them. I have heard of using subs to help minimize withdrawal I know I will have to pay the price, and feeling shitty is inevitable. But I would love it even if they made them 50% more bearable.   So my questions are:  1) Does a quick sub taper help at all?  2) What dose and for how long should I take them?  3) Does it not just push the withdrawal back a couple of days?  But any information or experience from anyone who has used subs during detox would be appreciated.   TLDR: Been abusing an opiate with a long half-life. Wondering if subs could help minimize withdrawal. Wondering how much to take/how long for. Thanks! """"","Negative"
1562,"Hey man so from my personal experience I take as much sub as I need to get comfortable the first two days maybe even on third day. So for example let's say 8mg day 1 and 2 and then maybe 6mg on day 3. On day 4 I would try to cut the dosage in half so 3mg. If it's not enough relief I would take a sliver (between 0.25mg - 0.5mg). Then day 5 try to cut the previous day dose in half again. I keep trying to cut the dose in half daily if possible. Once I can get through a day at 0.25mg I'll try to skip a day if possible. Then again cut in half so 0.125, then skip two days, dose again at 0.125, then hop off after going 3 days without dosing.   No matter what you will have to go through a period that will be uncomfortable, so the subs do prolong the inevitable; however it does make the inevitable easier.   I've had success multiple times in making the WD as mild as possible using the above method. I try to stay on subs and dose subs for the least amount of time as possible at the lowest dose possible.   Good luck man!  """"","Negative"

1692,"You got this! The first few days are obviously not fun, but then it gets better every day. It's super do-able -- tapering down as low as you did is 100% the way to go. Klonopin will be awesome for sleep -- once you can manage to get some sleep, it all gets better fast.   The weird thing about sub WDs is the up and down thing you described -- like you'll feel pretty ok, and then lousy, and then surprisingly good again. The ok periods get longer and the lousy ones will get way shorter over the next few days. The up/down symptoms have some benefits, though -- like the first time I came off sub I started feeling bad and panicked because I thought it would get worse and worse -- but then after 30 mins or so the wave of badness receded.   Anyway, other advice is regular stuff -- keep busy, don't obsess over how bad you feel. I would consider going back to work if you still are off -- having stuff to IME is WAY better than laying around at home. Like the last time I did this, on the very first day a friend had an exta ticket to a big concert -- I was reluctant because I felt lousy and it required 2 hours of public transpo to get there, but I was so glad I did it.

I went and took out a cash advanced (because I burned through my savings after quitting my job) so I could get straight two days ago. I figured I would just pay it back when I got paid, no biggie.

I bring this up because based on your comments you seem to be assuming that every one of these commets you post is going to read by her. She aint looking bro. If she wanted to hear you out or read what you had to say she would have called/texted ya back.   She is going to be *just fine* without you man. Its hard to realize that you need someone more than they need you but youre gonna have to realize that that‚Äôs the case sooner or later. I just wanna try and save you some dignity bro. Im sure you got more posts like this elsewhere and shit. When the ex i spoke of earlier looked up my posts she lost a lot of respect for me. Instead of coming off as psuedo-heroic as intended, i came off as clingy as fuck. And condescending. Just like you...  Youre **ex**-girl is safe dude. You sound young, like highschool young. And you weren‚Äôt ‚Äúprotecting her from herself‚Äù or whatever it is you think you were doing. She‚Äôs likely more than capable of ensuring her own safety.

I‚Äôve been using for the last almost 4 years now and I‚Äôm so sick of the life of a fiend once again! In these last 4 years I‚Äôve only managed to stay sober because I wanted to for about 2-3 weeks in a row, other then that few days here and there when I run out of money, schemes, borrowing, selling personal items, etc...

2419,"Pre-DNM used to be several online 'pharmacies' that would fedex painkillers -- they were slightly expensive, but totally legit. It was a crazy and nerve-wracking transaction, though. You would wire funds to a person in Tijuana, and then a package would arrive the next day from Southern California. They had pretty much everything from Vicodin all the way up to Fent lollypops. I never got ripped off, but lots of people did. Also similarly ordered lots of benzos and ambien and little .2mg buprenorphine tabs from India the same way. Cheap, but shipping took weeks, and if they decided to just take your money there was nothing you could do. Never happened to me, though. Only good experiences with Indian online pharmacies.   Anyway, sending money to some stranger you found on Whisper is a crazy! The whole point of Whisper or CL is to find someone local. No one in your area is selling? There is zero (or close to zero, but really I think zero) chance that this person is a fed. He or she is a zillion (10 zillion, a hundred zillion!) times more likely to be a scammer.   Anyway, if you want to get drugs through the mail use DNM. That is what it is for! From what I gather there are vendors who can get you your drugs really fast -- like potentially tomorrow. Otherwise get drugs in person! Sounds like that is what you are doing? Good luck! If you do live near a famous dope strip, then you are golden!   """"","Negative"

4969,"have you tried the common vein tricks like doing jumping jacks for a bit before attempting to inject? or taking a really hot shower, or running the vein under hot water? Maybe lifting some weights before attempting to shoot might make it a little easier for them to pop out as well. And lastly, I'm pretty sure this is right but don't quote me on this: if you're dehydrated, your veins are less likely to pop out visibly, so maybe drink a good bit of liquid (just make sure tho that you're not doing enough dope to be effected by the urinary retention side effect... UGH, having a full af bladder but being just unable whatsoever to piss until enough of the dope wore off a bit killed way too many a high of mine and was the main inducer of my 'opi-rage' episodes lol. I hope these tips can help. In the sidebar, or on google, check out the 'getting off right' manual for IV drug usage, it has great visuals, tips, and harm reduction/safety tips. Best of luck in the future!   P.S. boofing is typically the only other RoA that's comparable to IV, but doesn't require finicky veins to hit... *but* it does require your bowels to be as empty as they can of all shit, which, as an opiate addict, is often not that easy lol. But it's def a good RoA if you decide you're not able to hit a vein, but still want the maximum bioavailability and the closest resemblence to a rush/very fast onset. But if you're currently constipated and unable to shit out enough before dosing, then I'd say intranasal is the best bet then for you (even the water/dope/blood mix from your rig can be injected into your nose without the needle of course, only the syringe).   Hopefully you're able to go for the RoA you like best when you're able to do dope, but if you've tried a bunch and still can't get a vein, at least you can always boof or snort the solution. Hell even just adding a bunch of water and drinking it would be better than wasting it... but ik how bad the blood can harden/congeal in the rig if not dealt with quick enough once the blood enters the barrel of the syringe, and it depends how much blood/dope/water is in the mixture """"","Negative"

1,"Posted this on my old accout in 2016, it still applies though. Except with the refugee influx, we have a bunch of North africans/Syrians peddling bunk dope. Absolutely wouldn't recommend picking up from them folk, get your dope from Russians or Iranians like any kraut junkie worth his salt.  Germany has a pretty interesting dope scene, you wouldn't expect us to, but it's vibrant. Open air markets are pretty rare, save for major cities (by German standards, so at least 500k people). To make up for that we have other Junkie meet-up spots, like using kit vending machines, Methadone/Heroin clinics, or fixing rooms. Just shoot the shit with the locals, offer to toss them a bag or two, walk to the spot with them, and of course, DON'T LET YOUR MONEY WALK (some things are universal it seems). Get a number and there's your connect. The dope is always brown pretty much, it comes in from the ports of Amsterdam and Northwest Germany, at least that's my theory since the quality of dope is proportional to your distance from the Netherlands. Your gear comes wrapped in multiple sheets of plastic, my connect usually kept it in a fanny pak, which I thought was hilarious seeing him seemingly reaching into his crotch to pull out my product. You call the guy, he tells you where he's at, you take a walk (public transit fam, it's decent over here), and hand that shit over when you made sure feds ain't watching. So where do I fit into this? I'll keep it short since I don't wanna dwell on past fuck-ups too much. I'm currently in my mid-20s, med-school dropout, slow-as-mud recovering fiend and wageslave. 5K in the hole to boot, turns out you can't spend your academic scholarship on dope and coke when you end up dropping out two semesters in. Who'd a thought?! I don't fit into this scene at all, but it got me out of many sketchy situations where people who looked a bit more down on their luck to put it mildly got stopped and searched. Sat next to a cop on the train home with a gram and a half under my tongue, thank fuck it was wrapped up good. One of my more recent memories is meeting up at a train station which I will not disclose since it was pretty close to where I live. Wait for the d-boy to show up, he takes us on a wild goose chase around the city. First he has to pick up a recipe at the pharmacy (benzos, what else), then he starts getting into a public shouting match with a customer we ran into who had wronged him in the past (way to keep this discreet!). Randomly he stops to smoke his shitty spice, telling me to position myself in a way to hide him doing the deed. After a while he tells us to wait in a local park, he's gotta go to the source, break up the dope and bag it up. I am hurting at this point, it's been 24 hours. I hand him my 80 bucks though, since he's been trustworthy in the past and commence to lay down on a park bench. So here we are, four fiends growing more and more nervous every minute, pacing up and down, peeking down the street he left for. One hour, two hours. I'm starting to put this down as a loss when he walks up like an angel bringing the gospel of soon-to-be shot dope. Next thing we  head down to the local fixing room and prompty get denied. It's full apparently, fuck that's what I get for copping during junkie rush hour. We ask if we can be admitted into the other rooms out back, but they're apparently reserved for people smoking crack and dope, we're not allowed to shoot up back there since they can't guarantee we'll be attended to in the way appropriate for someone injecting (no staff, no clean needles to hand out, yadda yadda). We say fuck this, walk a few roads down to the next park and shoot up using our nasty ass rigs with the numbers off, as well as our dull as fuck needles. It did the job done more than well, I nod out immediately, my using ‚Äûbuddies‚Äú take off with my cotton and rig (lol), the cops mistake me for a drunk (it was Oktoberfest season), all is well. So that was that. If anyone is interested, I'll see if I can think of another story.  """"","Negative"

I got prescribed Suboxone 8mg per day and am supposed to see a Sub doc on Wednesday.  I also was taking 6 grams per day of Phenibut on average along with ~30 - 40 grams of Kratom before detox. During the 6 days I was in detox, they pumped me with a shitload of Phenobarbital for the Phenibut piece of the puzzle - 194.4 mgs for a few days, then a quick taper down to 64.8mg the day of discharge last Thursday. They then set me free with 5 32.4 mg pills as needed basically. I took two (64.8 mg on Friday), and on accident (seriously) took three yesterday 97.2mg. I meant to save the last for tonight but forgot I'd already taken two, to make the comedown smoother but whatever. I also was feeling incredibly anxious last night so I broke down and took 3 grams of Phenibut. Obviously I slept but this seems incredibly dangerous.   Point is, has anyone else here taken Phenibut with their opiate of choice? I really don't see myself just not taking any more Phenibut suddenly just because I got a weeks worth of Phenobarbital tapered extremely quickly. I'm sure I can skip the day dose of Phenibut. I can prob go down to 1.5 or 2 grams of Phenibut at night and taper down. At detox they didn't seem concerned giving me a hardcore, long acting barbituate in high doses with 8mg Suboxone - they only monitored my vitals in the morning, and let me sleep on huge doses of it alone in my room. I was a fucking total zombie the first two/three days: no memory of what was going on. I'm with it now and trying to figure out a plan here. Any thoughts? I don't know what to do exactly. I feel like they just staved off the Phenibut w/d with a barbituate and now I'm on an opiate that causes respiratory depression which Kratom didn't. Problem with Kratom was it was giving my tinnitus, and it was feeling unsustainable taking dose after dose since it had a short window of action.  I didn't feel any trouble breathing at all last night, but so what? I talk to a doctor on Wednesday. I'd really appreciate any advice rather than insults for how stupid I've been or whatever.

404,"What's up, y'all? So I have a quick question. This will look like a wall of text, but this needs just a little background info.  I'm a dope user, but I'm currently in the process of quitting (perpetually so). I was using basically every day, maybe a half gram to a gram or so, but it was pretty bunk shit, so take that with a grain of salt, it wasn't a HUGE habit or anything. So I went four days without using and my withdrawal symptoms were basically subsiding, RLS was subsiding big, I could actually get comfortable, still getting the chills and having diarrhea, but for the most part a mild day four. Well I used like 0.2 that night and went like two more days without using, but I was definitely experiencing WD symptoms slightly worse than I was on day four prior, but still not bad, just sweating like a mfer at night. So yesterday I needed to work a job outside for 8 hours straight. I'm starting to umpire youth baseball. So even though the WD symptoms weren't horrible by any means, the last thing I wanted was to be having the chills and hot/cold sweats while being outside in the cold and wind for 8 hours straight. So, I dosed about 0.25mg of sub, and it was enough to make me feel good, like I was completely clean. No euphoria or anything, just clean. Well it has now been 38 hours since I dosed that and I'm starting to get the chills again, so obviously I'm starting to WD from the sub. I start a new job on Thursday the 15th and *really* do not want to be having any WD symptoms when I start. In y'all's experience, do you think I should be fine by then? Do you think the WD I'll experience up until then will even be that severe? I know sub WD is supposed to peak around 72 hours, so I'm hoping it won't be too bad since I'm half way there and only have minimal symptoms, but I also know that sub WD can last a really long time, and I'm worried about not being over it by Thursday, or worst case scenario, having the WD be so drawn out that I don't start feeling really shitty until the middle of the week. Any help is appreciated! """"","Negative"

I have a decent tolerance and I know nausea is a common symptom of opiates but I'm definitely passed that point lol. And also kinda off topic but what's this rush everyone talks about when smoking percs? I can take a pretty good sized hit and I don't really get a rush, I definitely feel better almost instantly but that's just about it, I feel like snorting honestly gives me more of a nod then smoking and u figured this could be just because I do pressed 30s but a couple days ago I tried it with real 30s and it was the same situation and honestly I didn't like the real ones compared to the presses.

If you have those or at least the first three, getting through the first couple days is so much easier.

869,"Hi guys and gals, just did a shot of tar and as soon as I registered into a tiny vein on my hand, I started pushing slowly on the plunger. The first initial push stung like a mofo but didn't really burn after that sting when I tried pushing it in very very slow to see if the sting would happen again. It is kind of strange because I kept puling the plunger back to make sure i was still registered throughout. I went really slow and injected the H probably over 60 seconds.  1) I have hit an artery before (Or nerve) and it also stung and burned in those situations so I've had to pull the whole rig out. There was one time I was very naive (sometimes still am) and kept pushing the plunger in while it burned but whole area was so numb from it I didn't feel much pain when doing that. (1A) - but Do you guys think shooting into an artery would sting throughout the whole shot? (1B) And do you think it's possible that the needle tip was just partially in my vein and out at the same time where it could register blood, but also 'miss' partially if injected? Not sure if it matters but the vein I used is really small. It kind of runs over the pink knuckle and is barely visible.  2) After the shot, the area around it, about a 1 inch circumference, became alittle raised and random raised bumps showed up on my wrist and forarm also. Do you think that's an allergic reaction, or from a partial miss or definitely artery hit? Besides those raised areas, nothing else is puffy like when I hit an artery before. Also, nothing really hurts. 3) Random question I always wondered, When you guys put the cotton in the dope to draw up, how big of a piece do you use and do you actually stick the needle tip into the piece of cotton or just kind of push the tip against it and apply pressure while drawing it up?  Thanks all! Enjoy the rest of the night.  """"","Negative"
870,"Don't even try to shoot into tiny veins like that because you'll pretty much always miss atleast some of it, or completely blow the vein out. Sounds like you probably pushed through it and missed most of your shot. If you hit an artery your whole hand would swell up and it would feel way way way worse than what you described. I use a cotton about the size of a BB. I make sure the bevel is facing downward and I push down on the cotton when I draw the shot up, I don't push the needle through the cotton. Kinda hard to explain because I'm thwacked out as fuck but I hope you know what I mean. Edit: also the bumps you're talking about is a histamine reaction from missing part of your shot.

We did. I started feeling a little something but my boyfriend said he felt nothing yet. We each did another mg. About 20 more mins later I could definitely feel a small opiate buzz but definitely not stronger than one oxy has given me before. We decided that we should just finish off the rest of the pill. We also decided that rolling a joint would be a good course of action. By the time I was almost done rolling, I could definitely feel the buzz. We finished off the pill and started smoking the joint, sharing it with his roommate. I didn‚Äôt want to smoke too much cuz at this point I was in my happy place and I didn‚Äôt want the weed high to overpower the buzz. Now I‚Äôm writing this with a smile plastered on my face with occasional waves.  So in total, we both took 4 mg and smoked a third of a joint each. I‚Äôm really feeling it and I can tell he is too.

I lost more than 5 jobs while going to the clinic because they didn't give a fuck I worked 1st shift.

With companies on an attendance point system, it doesn't take long to point out while trying to maintain a normal life doing the right thing.

2004,"I want to talk about this/write it down so that I don't forget and veer off onto the wrong path again. Yesterday, I felt the most uncomfortable and painful feelings in my life. I used to do a lot of pills and cocaine when I was a teenager but grew out of that. Once I lost my brother I developed an alcohol addiction. Then, back in December, I shot heroin for the first time.  But before all I did was drink. I live with someone who has been a heroin addict for 5 years. I told him to go to a clinic and he agreed he would go. We had to pay $15 a day for a Methadone dose for him every morning. We used to work together and both lost our jobs because I was his manager and we were sleeping together. It's a bit more complicated than that though. He is from Romania and would screw up the register almost every night because he had trouble with our currency. My boss thought he was stealing from the drawer and would always ask me to keep an eye on him. Since I was always closing with him, and sleeping with him, they fired both of us.  The fun started when I got really drunk and we decided to buy some ice. I asked him to give me some because I was drunk and wanted to try it and he complied. I was addicted to the rush and had fun with it at first but it got old because we couldn't sleep and we started getting paranoid. Then we would miss the clinic and he told me he needed dope. Now I know he was bullshitting me but I didn't know, I felt bad for him.  Eventually, I started to do it. Then we ran out of money, cuz no job and paying $15 a day. We were getting dope by getting points for our dboy and giving him rides wherever he needed to go, selling off our shit, lying to our friends and family what we needed the money for until we exhausted all of our options. Eventually, we were both using every day until a few days ago. We had nothing, negative money in the account, burned bridges, no dope, no methadone, no food or gas money, no weed, smokes or beer to take the edge off.  Then withdrawal hit and holy hell. I had been through alcohol withdrawal and I know it can kill you but goddamn the withdrawal from dope was one of the most painful things I've experienced. I hit rock bottom. This guy doesn't love me, I know that but I'm glad he was there for me. He just held me in his arms while I shook and tremored and felt like I was dying. My bones hurt so bad I couldn't hold still. We just lied there in silence, other than my groans of pain, and I looked up in my dim room wondering what the fuck happened. How if I just died right then everything would be okay, well, for me. I had no prospects for the future and owe an ungodly amount of money and apologies to my friends and family. I hated my life and how I was so fucking stupid to put myself through this shit and how I let the man next to me down. I was supposed to help him and instead, I enabled him and used him, let him use me.  It's day 4 of being almost completely sober, took tylenol and vaped some tobacco, and I feel positive. Time to dig myself out of this mess. Not sure why I feel this unprecedented euphoria and positivity but I'm gonna take it and run with it. I don't really have any words of wisdom or encouragement for you guys but just knowing I won't be judged for talking about this gives me comfort. I barely had a taste of that life and now know I don't want to live that way, I can see it getting so much worse. I've seen how our dboy lives and read stories on here of withdrawing in prison. Maybe I'm a little bitch for typing this out but whatever, we all have our own paths. I was miserable unless I was watching him cook up the dope for us. Now I look forward to seeing the beauty life has to offer again and maybe this time, without the alcohol.  Thanks for reading. """"","Negative"

There is a 99% chance, in MY experience and countless others‚Äô, that you will not be able to get high just one time.  And every time i start using again my life gets progressively worse.   Like i said just always remember this pain you are going through, and when your brain tries to get you to do some dope, remind it that you dont want to go back to your lowest point.  I get what you are saying that you are in the rut of your life.  But the term rock bottom is generally used by addicts when we are at EXTREME lows.   I am not a big believer of the term rock bottom anyway because I always think I am at my trough, and then i end up doing worse shit that before, creating a new ‚Äúrock bottom‚Äù.   Its just surprising to me to see such a mild story associated with the term. Usually i hear, ‚Äú i sold my whip.

I realized when I typed this out I may sound like a little bitch or something for saying this is my rock bottom. I had a pretty good childhood and was very blessed with a wonderful family. Which is what makes me feel worse in a sense because I really had no reason to do this except curiosity and recreation. I honestly wouldn't have even considered it if I hadn't been drinking for the past 10 years with no change in my situation. I was miserable before and just looking to feel something I guess.

2235,"Since I‚Äôve been on and posted. Life here lately has just enjoyed throwing bullshit my way and I haven‚Äôt been able to catch a break. Haven‚Äôt been sick or anything, so that‚Äôs a good thing. Kept getting the run around on a lot of things, but what‚Äôs new. Anyways, this couple that my girl knows needed a ride to go pick up. Unless it‚Äôs worth my time I don‚Äôt fuck around with shit like that since it seems like I‚Äôm the only one around the area that still has a car and hasn‚Äôt sold it for drugs or some shit like that. Back to the couple. They said it would be worth my time and made sure it was going to be. Was still skeptical cause I‚Äôve heard that before and it wasn‚Äôt, figured if it was something like that again, I‚Äôd just kick em out of my car. For one, it was midnight, going through smaller towns and then hitting back roads. Sketches me out cause cops are dicks and think if you‚Äôre out that late, your up to no good. Long story short, split 3 30s between 4 of us. Haven‚Äôt had anything but .5mg of a sub 28hrs before that. Got first pull and split it with my girl. Did the shot and waited....and waited and waited. Didn‚Äôt feel a damn thing. Other couple didn‚Äôt feel a damn thing either. Figured at least ONE of us would have felt a little something. Got to lookin at the other 3 pills and they were m box 30s. Wellllll, that shit was fake as fuck! Still wondering what the fuck I shot up. Obviously wasn‚Äôt something horrible cause we‚Äôre all still fine. Very first time I‚Äôve ever come across a pressed pill, around my area. Its not common whatsoever here cause a lot of people haven‚Äôt even heard of presses and shit like that. Like I‚Äôve said in previous posts, live around a bunch of redneck tweakers. Basically a shit post but just still in shock. The guy tasted one after we all realized it wasn‚Äôt what it was supposed to be and he said it wasn‚Äôt bitter at all. I guess it wasn‚Äôt too bad cause I got another 8mg sub strip for $10 from a buddy I went to way earlier in the day for rox 20s but ended up being phenfrazine or some shit like that. Wasn‚Äôt his fault since he doesn‚Äôt dabble in this game much but he felt bad for me coming and not getting what I was hoping to get and felt compelled to find me something. So yeah, this weekend was basically total shit except for not being sick, which I‚Äôm thankful for but cheese and rice this was some shitty bullshit. Rant over for now.

2631,"but thats exactly what they are trying to do, https://www.heroinhelper.com/curious/chemistry/purifying_heroin.shtml its pretty basic, they make a hydrochloric acid solution to dissolve the black in a test tube and let that settle and pipette all the liquid out leaving behind the bulk of the insoluble particulate matter. they then add ammonium hydroxide to the solution to precipitate the soluble impurities out of the liquid as well. this is where im kinda lost  cause i do see reputable sources saying ammonium hydroxide is used to precipitate morphine from opium/acid solution, but i wonder does it also precipitate heroin? obviously we are dealing with something that already was seperated from the morphine. its been a while since chem and i was not a genius in that area for sure lol. anyway after that it follows the basic heroin recipe skipping the acetylization process and they add ethyl ether to make the water settle to the bottom and remove it from the heroin solution? then deacidify with baking soda until it stops bubbling and allow that to air dry giving you what they say is pure heroin and NaCL  thats a good question on why wouldnt cartels do it if it were so simple? perhaps it has a really poor yield? like if their total yield after converting was low enough that the premium price they would charge wont cover it then they wont. maybe they just dont like change lol. i do think you would be hard pressed getting these less educated junkies which are most of them, to pay a premium for what looks like a lot less to them though its actually super strong and its foreign looking to them. i thought about that when i considered if i could be the only powder dealer around here, even if it wasnt real 4 heroin it would be real strong but i doubt anyone would want to pay more. there are some things that dont make sense to me about the recipe but like i said i know about as much as the average person does about chemistry """"","Negative"
2633," also im wondering, since my main goal is to make bth easier on the veins and make it stronger i wonder if i really need to go through the step where i remove the soluble material, if i just extract the bth acid solution ill have removed the bulk of the unwanted contaminants, and if i dont have to spend money on ammonium hydroxide that would be nice not to mention that precipitate may remove other opiates present in bth that id rather keep. the soluble cut probably wouldnt amount to much i could then just skip straight to the deacidification get some litmus paper and add the baking soda like directed. ive actually heard of people straight adding baking soda directly to a shot of black but im not sure if this is advised """"","Negative"

They went through every pill bottle (all scripted and legit), every article of clothing, every item at least twice. It was horrible. And I‚Äôve heard other countries in the Middle East and Asia can be really hardcore with this kind of enforcement as well, not to mention the consequences. So pick somewhere safe. That said, I never had an issue traveling domestically with any kind of pills. Just put em in a prescription bottle with your name on it or an otc med bottle. I had no problem carrying methadone either - I‚Äôd put it right on the top of my carry on in a ziplock.

Mixing opiates with other chemicals can kill you. Yes shooting too much can kill you. But the consistency of dope is never the same. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in the shit.

I woke up sick as fuck and couldn‚Äôt do much. Once I realized I was gonna have more trouble than expected getting the cash I sent dboy a text asking if he could front us a G or a half until tomorrow.

I drag ass through this job and manage to get $45 for it. Perfect, pack of smokes and a half.  I call the plug up and ask if I can come through for a half. ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs cool man. I also meant to tell you that we can do the other thing you asked about‚Äù. Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. The thing that pisses me off the most is after a few hours with no reply I contemplated sending him a followup message about the front but decided not to to avoid pissing him off.

So it becomes a race to find what antibiotics will work, cultures take 48 hours normally to find which antibiotics will work so they cover with vanco, if you're allergic to it you're fucked basically.

336,"**Negative-pressure wound therapy**Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a therapeutic technique using a vacuum dressing to promote healing in acute or chronic wounds and enhance healing of second- and third-degree burns. The therapy involves the controlled application of sub-atmospheric pressure to the local wound environment, using a sealed wound dressing connected to a vacuum pump. The use of this technique in wound management increased dramatically over the 1990s and 2000s and a large number of studies have been published examining NPWT. NPWT appears to be useful for diabetic ulcers and management of the open abdomen (laparotomy) but further research is required for other wound types.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/opiates/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 """"","Negative"

1232,"yeah sorry I thought i had a solution, but i tried experimenting on myself (i have like 500 used rigs i been meaning to dispose of properly) and it was working up until you pull back to register in the vein. If you pull back too hard or fast, the piece comes apart. But basically, if you see your plunger has the black rubber piece which goes into the syringe first. You can pull that off easily and insert it onto something else that will fit in the syringe. I tried placing the black rubber piece on the long thin piece inside a pen which has the ink tip on it. (Forgot what its called), and on the opposite side of the side with ink. It fit pretty well and inserts pretty easily. If the dope was freshly mixed with water and moved smoothly, I think it would work. but since the dope is mixed with blood and harder to press, when you insert it and pull back, the pen piece comes out, which will leave the black plunger piece stuck in there. If you can find a better item to stick the black piece on, so it won't come off easily, it might work. (Perhaps a thin screwdriver? Because the item inserted into the black rubber piece needs to have a wider circumference at the end then the middle, so it doesn't slip out when you move it back and forth inside the plunger- idk if that makes sense?)

Honestly, I don‚Äôt get why meth is such a problem when opiates are soooo much better! I do meth because it‚Äôs what I can get, but I‚Äôm in love with the feeling of oxy already. I‚Äôd choose an oxy high over meth any day. My usual dose of oxycodone (1-2 times weekly) is 30mg, crushed pills. The problem I‚Äôm faced with? There‚Äôs no supply! Everyone here is doing meth so I only manage to get oxys when somebody I‚Äôm hanging out with has them in their medicine stash. Sure, there‚Äôs always the onion patch.. but even then, domestic opiate pharms (Australia) are expensive as fuck! So that leaves me with two choices... Lack the beautiful feeling of an opiate high that my body and mind yearn for.. or do heroin. I‚Äôm already a meth addict... so there‚Äôs no ‚Äòheroin is bad ahh I‚Äôm scared‚Äô mental barrier sorta thing. The thought of fent scares me though.. How does heroin compare to oxy? I assumed it would be stronger mg to mg.. but from what I‚Äôve read, oxy is typically stronger. If I managed to get some good quality H from the onion fields, what dosage can I expect to get me where 30mg oxy gets me? Is it a similar high or totally different? Elaborate? I‚Äôd prefer to avoid the needle.. what other ROA will get me feelin‚Äô nice? Can I simply weigh x amount of h, cap it and swallow it? Please opiate masters, guide me to a heroin habit........ why am I like this? Edit: PS sorry for infiltrating your sub with my methed out wall of text.

Realistically there isn‚Äôt much of a difference, oxy might be a bit more energetic and of course you never know exactly what‚Äôs in that bag of dope. But the rest is up to you.

And didnt want to get hooked again. Took 20mg like once every one or two months and everything was good... it was equal to heroin use ime. It is not this overwhelmingly powerful as someone describes the first shot and it easily gives you a couple hours of joy without to much compulsiveness. The downward spiral started when I first tried fent-patches(extracted and snorted, later smoked) cause of the urge to redose a hour later. I couldnt have a great night without redosing and the process stuck in my head. Even now (after half a year of clean time) I think about smoking fent and how fucking good it was just cause I read your post.

I walked up behind him and said, ‚Äúhey, you got those lotto folds?‚ÄùHe smiled and we talked for a while. I could tell he was pissed about something but in line at the gas station wasn‚Äôt the place to hash it out. I spent the rest of the day trying to recall just what I did to fuck him over and the only thing I could come up with is that I showed his son how to use a needle. Truth be told, at the time I was under the impression that his son, my good friend at the time, had shot up before because he told me as much. He said he was having a hard time hitting and asked if I‚Äôd help. So I did. Soon after I moved to the otherside of the country and ten years slide by. I move back and find out my homie got popped writing bad scripts, reduced his time by ratting on his friends, and still did time on a handful of felonies. I‚Äôm almost certain that he told his folks I taught him to use a needle and in their minds all of the shit their kid did is my fault.This wasn‚Äôt the first time shit like this happened either. Years ago a girl I ran with and dated did the same thing. Told me she shot up before and asked if I‚Äôd help her hit. Again, she came from a dope using family so I didn‚Äôt question her. Fast forward a few years and she‚Äôs downstate turning tricks and a few people want to fuck me up for introducing her to the needle....The thing is, in both cases, I probably would have shown them both how to inject if they had been honest about it being their first time. I used to volunteer at a mobile syringe exchange, I‚Äôm a proponent of harm reduction and have seen and lived the consequences of unsterile injection practices.

3197,"I think I never had anything to do with people that young, except for the time I myself was as young. And at that time I used to hang with much older people. I still had the term bad influence attached to my name, tho (jokingly I hope). Last year I fixed a friend who only snorted dope for more than 10 years his first shot. But he asked me to and after he didn't fell down the rabbit hole anymore than he already had, so we still cool. And another friend, too, when I'm thinking about it. He didn't stick with the needle either, I'm glad to say. I know it wouldn't be my fault, but still, I'd feel a little guilty I think. But in the end, we're all old enough to make out own decisions. And when some little shit decides to steal and lie and trick people into helping them with becoming an addict, they will. Parents who blame others for the shortcomings of their lil angels fail their kids as parents. If they don't recognize that their kid has a fucking problem and pretend that humans work like that, they are the bad guys. No one I know or heard of got forced or seduced to use. Everyone has their own reasons to go after opiates, being badly influenced is rarely one of them afaik.  """"","Negative"
3199,"The only thing i find really scummy is i shot up a16yo girl. Similar story to yours. We were texting, i had no idea how old she was but she claimed she was older than she was, and dating some dude in his late 20s who had just got locked up. He was her connect. She was hooking me up with a ton of bars for some dope, cuz her bf was the only one she knew with a plug. So the first time we meet I'm on my way to her and she mentions she couldn't grab rigs and asked me to. No problem. Well i show up and she is clearly young af and needed me to get rigs cuz she's to young. She also has a broken arm and couldn't hit herself because of it and asked me to do it for her. I don't use needles but i know how, and since i was already there and whatnot i decided to help her. I loaded up the smallest amount possible, and she ended up not feeling a thing cuz i honestly didn't want to do it but figured at that point I'd go through the motions to get my bars. I never helped her after that. I spoke to her a few times since and she was in a bunch of trouble for stealing a bunch of laptops from her high school. I don't blame myself for any of her actions, i was tricked into the situation. I should have said fuck it and left but i was in a bad way and really needed those bars to help detox myself. I did what i could to make the best of a bad situation. I don't think you are to blame for those peoples mistakes. Who knows, maybe they wood have tried to hit themselves and gotten endo, or an abscess, or worse. I know if a friend said no to scoring for me, is have gone elsewhere to get what i want.

Thats literally the main thing there looking for I had plenty of self harm scars at the time and they never said shit about them. But yeah the first time they have to do an intake and get all your info call the centers and see what paperwork you need to bring, I had to bring i.d. and a W-2 / social security card. But every time we went after that we would just go to a terminal and you'd answer a bunch of questions ( same shit every time just asking specific ass questions but one of them is do you currently use drugs and do you consent to a blood test if they feel like you are , and if you have to agree if you want to donate lol) but honestly I saw way worse people then me and my girl in there and if we were there you bet your ass we were W/D hard Fucking core. But anyways you do the questions then go to evaluation where they check your blood Everytime and your pulse/ heart rate and check for track marks, as long as you only have a mark from the plasma need your golden. But if you pass evaluation you go into another line where you wait for a chair to open up. it just depends how busy and what day it is, some days I'd be there for 4 hours and some days I'd be in and out asap it just depends.It definitely makes you a little woozy after but if your already W/D I promise it won't stop you we would immediately go pull the cash out as soon as we were done.( If you have good blood flow the general time is 45 mins - an hour to finish donating AFTER your hooked up and already donating and all that.) And also they don't do cash at least not here, they give you a credit card with a pin and you can pull cash out at special ATM's or gas stations that allow cash back.I couldn't tell you how much you'll get paid, for me the first 5 visits we're 50$ per person and then after that it's 24$-34$ (depends on weight the heavier you are the more plasma you can give and gett paid more) but like I said this is how it was for me. I'm in the southwest region. The place I went to was CSL Plasma so idk how many other centers they have but I'm sure the rules are the same, good luck man it's not t to bad after the first time.

If you are, please dose small to start -- like 10mg max. You can always take more, but once it's in you it's in you.If you aren't going to defeat the time release, remember that you are in for like 8 to 10 hours of being high -- I can't imagine that it would be fun to be nauseated for that many hours because you took too high of a dose.

3999,"I must vent for a minute! Back in september I got into an accident. It was a beautifull day and I was hiking the cliffs by me, it started to rain so I headed back, got in my car, put on some tunes, pulled out of the lot and then that's when the day turned, it was also the last day I walked on my own two feet.[Now the accident, I dont remeber, but it was my fault. It was a shitty road and rainy but I was going too fast and wasn't paying attention, I'll totaly own up to that, lesson was learned. I'm still recovering from that terrible car accident.]After being helped out of the car [adrenaline is crazy] and lying on the side of the road covered in glass, blood and with multiple broken bones. [thought I was gonna loose my leg] I was strait sober, BUT I had my nectar collector, oil, some pills and a few tabs of lsd in my backpack, I woulda chucked it all in the woods if I coulda moved. Anyway the park ranger showes up and dose absolutely nothing for me, he just immediately starts searching the car, opens my backpack like a kid at Christmas, asking me a bunch of dumbass questions and doesn't ask me if I'm even ok. [I was litteraly dying] He goes though my whole car [what was left of it] found a bunch of empty whip it canisters in my trunk, in my recycling with some empty beer cans, again recycling. [I live in the middle of nowhere so I gotta drop that shit off] Eventually emt's show up, had to get airlifted to hospital, blacked out before it even showed, woke up days later in the hospital on a ventilator, multiple blood transfusions, my moms crying, just sucked yo. Come to findout from a nurse, the same cop was calling the hospital to get blood samples trying to make his case against me I guess. Only had thc in my system at the time [thc is in my bone marrow, lol] Anyway they told him to fuck off, they were awesome at the trauma unit, hooked me up with the iv dillauded, you know, with the button, just press as needed, aaaaaaaah....The ranger had my phones, money [had a few Hundo on me] and backpack with all my shit in it as evidence, wouldn't give me my phones back because I wouldn't give them the passwords. [fuck that!] Took forever to get back, had to get a lawyer, got a STACK of tickets and shit, DUI, possesion of various substances, paraphernalia, wreckless driving, so on and so on. I gotta go to federal fucking court cause it was on federal land [national park]. Dude threw the book at me and just made a bunch of shit up. For example, texting and driving which I wasn't and no seat belt which I had on, I litterally have the scar to prove my seatbelt was on and surley woulda died if I didnt, just a heartless Bastard.I lost my car, still can't walk, have damages to pay, can't work, strait broke, bored, sober, had to move out of my place, almost out of food, the worst. Once again I was strait sober, I was on my way to a friends house to get fucked up, but I'm still getting an OUI, I'll most likely loose my licence and federal laws on possesion are not kind, so possible jail time. Just the absolute worst. So what confounds me is, why would you want to make it even worse for me yo, why!?

Well ive had enough of this demon and decided FUCK IT! Im throwing away all my gear (i dont shoot) like foils tooters and my old container for dope. Well I was about to hop on reddit and decide WHAT THE FUCK should i do? I have NO motivation sober. I hate everyone. Every girl ive met has seemed to screw me over and im just an awkward boring drug addict dude. i spend half my day research pharmacology and a lot of times just readin about opiates. this addiction is unhealthy and turning me into a worn out zombie.

So like shit, here i am smoking. but im deciding to make a list of things to do when i get sober tomorrow. Im planning on no longer using opiates. But to be honest i hate life when im totally sober to the point of suicide idealization. Ive dug myself and my family in a deep financial hole by getting fired. I only make enough to support my drug habit. I cant use other drugs to substitute opiates, weed makes me foggyheaded as all hell and i burns holes in my memory. benzos are addictive and i dont want to physically withdrawal from TWO substances. and i LOVE uppers but ive only used meth ONCE in my life (well actually it was a 3 day bender but that was the first and last time i used meth. loved it too much i knew i had to stay away) and i crave no drug EXCEPT OPIATES. Life doesnt fulfill me but opiates make it bearable and give me a reason to smile. Does anyone TRULY stop craving opiates and enjoy life after quitting? how long does it take? i literally get headaches all day and begin hating myself if i dont do opiates. but when i use opiates i function like a normal person and im even fun to be around (untill i run out). but when im sober all i think about is getting high. Suboxone really doesnt even cut it. Help me quit reddit? I feel like im  a little too deep in. My family is dissapointed in me, no girls care about me and most of my friends use drugs.

5033,"It's an illness. The fact that SO many people have become addicted to opiates more than implies that they can't all be 'bad people'. Further indicating it is a mental illness caused by these chemicals. If people could just stop.. they would. Who wants to spend all their money, stealing from their own family, hanging around on street corners waiting to score in all weathers, in constant conflict with the police.. all just to 'feel well'. There is no great high after a time of abuse either.But no.. we are arresting people who can't stop and most of them whose fault they are in that mess in the first place is that of the doctors and the massive fucking company creaming off the profits from addictive medicine.In a way and this sounds terrible, but perhaps having heroin available (and I don't mean lethal fentanyl) saved peoples lives because they weren't stuck paying ridiculously high prices to doctors and pharmacies for their 'medicine' which makes you feel like you're sick without it. I'm certain there are plenty of people that took what was prescribed, aren't knowledgeable about anything medical and didn't know what the hell was happening to them when they tried to quit. I bet that was a fast learning curve.The whole thing is a fucking mess, and now over 100,000 innocent people have been blown up or gunned down in mexico fighting over all the money that is pouring out of the USA and into cartel hands. It's time to legalize. There is no other way. Nothing else is going to work to help people. War on Drugs has been an utter failure for 100+ years. Prohibition has never worked, never will.. The phrase 'Crime Doesn't Pay' is utter bullshit. The money anywhere near illegal drugs is absurd - and its all flowing OUT of our economy (and into the laundromat called HSBC!)-TL;DR-If you feel like this and its only the shame or admitting to someone the point you've reached - get over it. Ask for help. This illness will NOT let you quit by yourself. Every time I go through detox, I feel like I really want it in the beginning. I give my phone, my credit cards, my keys - everything - to the person looking after me. Yet by day 7-10 I'm trying to scam them back off the person to relapse.. despite going through the worst of the withdrawals and being nearly back to normal. It's the lack of sleep and the psychological that gets me. It's so messed up.. it makes no sense. There is no rationality in addiction, hence its classification as mental disorder.

Anyhow, I was able to scrounge up some stuff from some old cottons and it's crazy how much better I feel. I went from being mopey and not being able to get out of bed to being all talkative and feeling like I could run a 5k. It's really crazy how much of a hold opiates can get over you. Have you guys read The Odyssey? The Island of the Lotus eaters had to be based on poppy eaters or something. Maybe Homer had a bit of experience with opiates that inspired him to write that bit.Are opiates the worst addiction?

5590,"This is honestly 90% of heroin's appeal. If you just go from feeling normal to getting high, it ain't all that great.
